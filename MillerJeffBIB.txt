  abstract = {When people must respond discriminatively to one or two stimuli by making one or two taps of a response key, they initiate the response more rapidly when the correct number of taps matches the number of stimuli (compatible condition) than when it mismatches (incompatible condition; Miller, Atkins, \& Van Nes, 2005). In the Miller et al. (2005) studies, there was also sometimes an effect of compatibility on response execution time, as reflected in the interresponse intervals between successive taps. We report two further experiments generalizing the numerosity compatibility effects on response initiation time and interresponse intervals to two- versus three-stimulus sequences. In addition, we varied gap length between stimuli to see whether the rhythm of the stimulus would influence that of the response. Weak rhythmicity effects were repeatedly found, but these were too small to suggest a plausible alternative explanation for the numerosity compatibility effect on response initiation time.},

In Experiment 1, the normal/mirror-image information determined whether the response was to be executed (go) or withheld (no-go), and LRPs indicated that responses were weakly prepared before the end of mental rotation. Mental rotation was not required in Experiment 2, and significantly more response preparation was observed. In Experiment 3, probe RT trials embedded in the mental rotation task indicated that hand information is available to the response preparation process during rotation. Apparently, some response preparation occurs before mental rotation finishes, but rotation interferes with response preparation.},

In Exp III, the stimuli indicated up and down positions, while the responses were movements to the right and left. In this case, the mapping up/left and down/right was preferable for the right hand, and the reverse mapping was preferable for the left hand. Results are most easily explained by assuming that counterclockwise rotational movements are preferable for the right hand, while clockwise is preferable for the left. These preferences are manifest through combinations of implicit movements toward the stimulus and explicit movements toward the response key. This principle provides a simpler explanation for some previously reported S compatibility effects.},

We replicated this study with response side as an additional factor and found a main effect of match, as well as a Simon effect with faster responses when the required response matched the visual field in which the word pair was presented. We did not, however, observe an interaction between the match effect and the visual field. This challenges the assumption that coarse semantic representations, including spatial properties of objects, are mainly processed in the right hemisphere.},

Literature suggesting that a similar fading mechanism influences RTs in masked identity priming inspired us to check an analogous semantic priming paradigm for nDPs.  Consistent with the findings in other paradigms, two masked semantic priming experiments revealed stronger priming effects for relatively fast than for relatively slow responses, thus reflecting a nDP.  These findings are compatible with the ideas that the activation produced by masked semantic primes decreases over the course of a trial, like that of irrelevant spatial information and of masked identity primes, and that nDPs are a general signature of within-trial decreases in response activation across different tasks and paradigms.},

To this end, participants were asked to respond as rapidly as possible to the onset of any flash. Following their response, they additionally indicated whether they perceived a single flash or a double-flash. Most importantly, we observed significant shorter reaction times in response to redundant flashes, irrespective of whether they were physically presented or illusorily perceived. Taken together, our results suggest that an illusory percept can affect simple reaction time in much the same manner as the corresponding physical stimulation.},

As expected, using the crosstalk logic we found clear evidence for parallel retrieval of semantic categories when there was categorical overlap between tasks (Experiment 1). Locus of slack based evidence for parallel semantic retrieval was found, however, both in conditions with (Experiment 1) and without categorical overlap between tasks (Experiment 2). Crucially, however, increasing the demand for resources required to switch from Task 1 to Task 2 eliminated even the locus of slack based evidence for parallel memory retrieval in PRP (Experiment 3). Together, our results suggest that parallel retrieval is not bound to conditions of categorical overlap between tasks, but instead is contingent upon resources needed for switching between tasks (e.g., Oriet, Tombu, \& Jolicoeur, 2005).},

The present study employed high and low probability trials in a go-no/go task, to investigate whether these processes are impaired in people with mild to moderate Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that the patients would demonstrate abnormal patterns of response force with manipulations on response readiness. It was further hypothesized that the patients would display evidence of an inability to inhibit responses on no/go trials. Both hypotheses were supported, suggesting that a basic deficit associated with PD is related to the transmission of response activation to the motor system. Response modulation appears to depend on the integrity of basal ganglia structures.},

Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were measured in a modified memory scanning task. In Experiment 1, each trial began with the presentation of a colored precue that indicated which hand might be needed to respond. The memory set membership of a letter appearing 700 ms later determined whether the primed response should be made or withheld. Response preparation was initiated by the precue before the letter appeared. More important, LRP amplitude continued to increase after the letter was presented, suggesting that once response preparation had been initiated it was continued in parallel with memory scanning. Experiment 2 investigated whether the difficulty of the concurrent memory search affects the rate at which LRP amplitude increases. The S-R mapping in the memory scanning task was changed from consistent to varied to increase cognitive demands. The findings of Experiment 1 were replicated, and comparisons across experiments suggested that the difficulty of the concurrent process has little effect on the continuation of response preparation. Considered in conjunction with previous findings, these results support the view that motoric response preparation consists of at least two qualitatively distinct phases--initiation and continuation.},

  abstract = {In simple, go/no-go, and choice reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster to two redundant targets than to a single target. This redundancy gain has been explained in terms of a race model assuming that whichever target is processed faster determines RT (Raab, 1962). Miller (1982) presented a race model inequality to test the race model by comparing the RT distributions of single and redundant target conditions. Here, we present simulations indicating that the standard tests of this inequality (for a description of the testing algorithm, see Ulrich, Miller, \& Schroeter, in press) are afflicted with systematic biases and Type I error accumulation. Systematic biases tend to produce violations of the race model inequality, but they decrease as the numbers of observations increase. Reasonably unbiased tests of the race model inequality are obtained for sample sizes of at least 20 for each target condition. In addition, Type I error accumulates because of testing the inequality at multiple percentiles. To reduce Type I error, the race model inequality should be tested in a restricted range of percentiles, preferably in the percentile range 10% to 25%.},

This effect shows that peripheral motor aspects of primary task responses can still be influenced by inhibition even when the stop signal arrives too late to prevent the response. It thus requires modification of race models in which responses in the presence of stop signals are either stopped completely or produced normally, depending on whether the responding or stopping process finishes first.},

Therefore, we investigated whether previously observed SI effects reflect not only selective response inhibition but also other effects caused by the appearance of the stop signal. In Exp 1, we controlled for the possible extra influences of the stop signal and still found SI effects, allowing a more confident attribution of SI effects to global inhibitory processes. Furthermore, the extra signal affected the motor system, as revealed by a reduction of SI effects on response force after the improved control. Using the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), Exp 2 showed that the extra signal affected relatively central motor processing. The findings thus advance our knowledge about the distinction between signal-related and motor-inhibitory effects in stop-signal tasks.},

An important experimental setting for dual-task situation is the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, and the dual-task performance decrements in the PRP paradigm is referred to as PRP interference. The standard response selection bottleneck (RSB) models states that the response selection stage of the second task (T2) cannot start until the response selection stage of the first task (T1) finishes, resulting in the PRP interference. Contrary to the prediction of RSB models, several researchers have found T2's modulations on T1's performance, and have suggested that T1's selection-related processes are affected by T2's selection-related processes, referred to as backward crosstalk effects. The locus of backward crosstalk effects is not clear, however, because RTs were measured in most previous studies. By using semantically unrelated stimuli and responses and by measuring T1's lateralized readiness potential (LRP), we examined the locus of backward crosstalk effects. We found that the interval between T1's stimulus onset and the stimulus-locked LRP onset was affected, suggesting T2's response selection starts before T1's selection is complete. The present result provided electrophysiological evidence focusing on T1's changes in favour of the hypothesis of parallel response selection in the PRP paradigm.},

In the first experiment, confidence predicted accuracy even at stimulus durations so brief that subjects claimed to be performing at chance. This finding indicates that subjects's claims that they are "just guessing" should not be accepted as sufficient evidence that they are completely unaware of the stimuli. Experiments 2-4 tested directly for subliminal perception by comparing the minimum exposure duration needed for better-than-chance discrimination performance against the minimum needed for confidence to predict accuracy. The latter durations were slightly but significantly longer, suggesting that under certain circumstances people can make perceptual discriminations even though the information that was used to make those discriminations is not consciously available.},

Actually, such an optimization tendency was found, more so for the mental rotation task and for the blocked SOA condition. The results indicate that preparation, Task 1 characteristics, and TRT (total reaction time) optimization are -- amongst others -- factors influencing central processing order in PRP-tasks.},

We examined the sampling distributions of three parameters of this model when applied to a ratings procedure: the area under the ROC (Az), the normalized difference between the means of the underlying signal and noise distributions (da), and the slope of the ROC on z-coordinates (s). Statistical bias (the degree to which the mean of the sampling distribution differed from the true value) was trivial for Az, small but noticeable for da, and substantial for s. Variability of the sampling distributions decreased with the number of trials, and was also affected by the number of response categories available to the participant and the overall sensitivity level.

The dependence of RF on response probability was insensitive to foreperiod length and to the use of loud auditory response signals, although the dependence of RT on response probability was sensitive to both of these manipulations. In combination with previous findings, these results provide evidence that RT and RF can be dissociated. We describe an extension of Naatanen's readiness model that can account for the effects of response probability on RF and RT. According to this model, the distance between motor activation and a threshold for action is relatively large when subjects are unprepared, and a large increment is needed to exceed this threshold, resulting in slow but forceful responses. A possible neurophysiological implementation of this model is suggested.},

The present study was conducted to unravel the effects of stimulus and response probability. Experiment 1 manipulated stimulus probability and revealed that responses to a more probable stimulus are less forceful than responses to a less probable stimulus even when both stimuli require the same response. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this stimulus probability effect does not depend on the overall level of response probability. Experiment 3 showed an analogous effect for response probability when stimulus probability is kept constant. The complete pattern of results suggests that both stimulus probability and response probability affect the forcefulness of a response. It is argued that response probability exerts a direct influence on the motor system, whereas stimulus probability influences the motor system indirectly via premotoric adjustments.},

Exps II and III, with 32 and 8 Ss, respectively, showed that 3-dimensionality is not sufficient either. What is important is that the target lines be structurally relevant to the figure. However, structural relevance of a target segment to the figure as perceived with unlimited viewing time is not perfectly correlated with perceptibility under tachistoscopic conditions; it appears that the targets that fall on the external contour of a figure may be facilitated even without a high degree of structural relevance. In view of this, a model is suggested in which perceivers use processing heuristics to direct processing to aspects of the input that are potentially important for determining the structure of the final figure, working primarily from the outside in.},

Previous evidence indicating that these models are inconsistent with results from same trials is summarized, and a new test of the above assumption using data from different trials is proposed. Detailed analysis of reaction times from different trials is shown, at least for some pairs of dimensions, to be incompatible with the view that separate same-different decisions are reached for each dimensions. The major finding from 2 experiments using 52 right-handed Ss, is that there were more relatively fast responses in a condition with 2 dimensions different, compared with the 2 conditions with only 1 of the dimensions different, than any processing model treating the dimensions separately could predict.

Exps III-VI provide evidence that stimulus probability had its effect on the availability of an abstract code that was generated by the encoding process from the visual input. Results from the experiments with letter stimuli are interpreted using a model similar to the logogen model of J. Morton (1969). Experiments with nonsense forms suggest that Ss used abstract codes in dealing with the forms only when the stimuli were constructed from a set of orthogonal features. A secondary finding was that visual quality had an effect that extended past the feature analysis stage and into a stage in which the visual input activated an abstract code. This result calls into question the common practice of interpreting the interaction of a factor with visual quality as evidence that the factor affects visual feature analysis.},

A bimodal detection task required a simple speeded response to either a visual or an auditory signal. A letter search task required a choice response depending on whether or not a two-letter display included the signal letter "A." Data from both tasks are inconsistent with the prediction. When two signals are presented, responses are faster than separate-activation models can explain.

To control the information available at various times during stimulus identification, some relevant stimulus characteristics were made easy or difficult to discriminate. Ss were 68 right-handed undergraduates. The usefulness of partial output was varied by manipulating the assignments of stimuli to responses. For some mappings, partial information could contribute to effective response preparation because the responses consistent with partial information were assigned to fingers on the same hand; for other mappings, partial information was assigned to fingers of different hands. Performance differences between these mappings were considered evidence that partial information about a stimulus was transmitted to response activation processes before the stimulus was identified and thus were considered evidence against discrete transmission of information about the stimulus as a whole. Results suggest that information is transmitted discretely with respect to stimulus codes, although distinct codes activated by a single stimulus may be transmitted at different times.},

Stimulus sets were chosen so that recognition processes could extract incomplete preliminary information about a stimulus faster than they could extract secondary information needed for stimulus identification. Discriminability of secondary information was manipulated to vary the opportunity for response preparation (RP) based on preliminary information, with difficult secondary discriminations providing more time for RP than easy ones. Precues were given on some trials to allow RP to occur before the stimulus was presented, thereby reducing any difference in RP as a function of discriminability. Continuous models predict that precues should facilitate RP less when the secondary discrimination is difficult than when it is easy, and discrete models predict equal facilitation regardless of secondary discrimination difficulty. Evidence of RP was obtained with some but not all stimulus sets. Results are interpreted as support for the asynchronous discrete coding model.},

In Exp II an inducing target occurred with high probability in 1 of 4 display locations, and a test target occurred with equal probability in all 4 locations.

An important practical consequence of the bias in median reaction time is that sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions. If medians are used with unequal sample sizes, then the bias may produce an artifactual difference in conditions or conceal a true difference.

In 2 experiments, a figure that included more offset-transient line segments in the offset-transient letters was used.

Specifically, the estimated threshold approaches the minimum of the distribution of true thresholds, and the power of an experiment to detect subliminal perception is reduced. Because there is much evidence that true thresholds vary across trials, threshold variability may have seriously weakened previous experiments that tested for subliminal perception. Fortunately, it is possible to estimate the maximum power loss resulting from threshold variability and therefore to design an experiment with acceptable power even in the presence of variability.},

In Experiment 1 the stimulus consisted of one or two high or low pitch tones, and participants were required to respond with one or two taps of a response key depending on stimulus pitch. Responses were faster when the number of tones matched the required number of response taps than when these numbers mismatched. Experiment 2 showed that a weaker version of this effect can also be obtained using visual stimuli, and Experiment 3 showed that the analogous effect can even be obtained, albeit very weakly, with bimodal stimuli. There was also evidence that the number of stimuli affected the rate of emitting the two-tap response. These results indicate that stimulus numerosity is processed automatically to the level at which it can affect the selection and possibly the execution of a varying number of responses.},

Visual stimuli were presented on the left side of fixation, on the right side, or on both sides, and in the RT task participants had to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of any stimulus. The same stimulus displays were also presented in a counting task, for which participants had merely to count the stimuli. Hemisphere-specific movement-related potentials contralateral and ipsilateral to the responding hand were isolated by subtracting count-task ERPs from RT-task ERPs. Consistent with the hemispheric coactivation model, there was evidence of movement-related ipsilateral positivity as well as contralateral negativity, suggesting that the motor areas of both hemispheres contribute to response initiation in simple RT. The distinction between contralateral and ipsilateral motor activation appears useful in clarifying the roles of the two hemispheres in response initiation.},

This article reports three experiments testing an account of that enhancement in which normals' responses to bilateral stimuli are slowed by interhemispheric inhibition. In simple RT tasks, normal participants responded bimanually to left, right, or bilateral visual stimuli. In choice RT tasks, they responded to each stimulus with one hand, responding bimanually only when both stimuli were presented. Measurements of response forcefulness (Experiment 1) and electroencephalographic activity (Experiments 2 and 3) showed no evidence for the patterns of negative correlations predicted by the hypothesis of interhemispheric inhibition.

Although the data from an initial experiment can be used to estimate one type of replication probability, this estimate will rarely be precise enough to be of any use. The other type of replication probability is also unknowable, because it depends upon unknown aspects of the research context. Thus, although it would be nice to know the probability of replicating a significant effect, researchers must accept the fact that they generally cannot determine it, whichever type of replication probability they seek.},

Cue-related activity at Cz was more positive with hand than foot cuing, reinforcing the conclusion that Cz activity is sensitive to selective preparation for one of these limb systems.

In particular, the idea that individual racers proceed at the same speed in the single and redundant conditions (also known as ``context independence'') is shown to be better understood as an inherent part of Raab's (1962) original race model than as a separate, additional assumption. Thus, evidence that individual racers proceeded at different speeds in the single and redundant conditions, if available, should be viewed as supporting one type of coactivation model rather than an alternative model. In addition, it is shown that a class of race-like models without the assumption of context independence is so broad that it can never be falsified.},

These models are thought to have difficulty, however, explaining the commonly observed "backward compatibility effect" (BCE), which is the finding that the speed of first-task responses depends on their compatibility with later second-task responses. One explanation of this phenomenon is based on a distinction between an early response activation stage and a subsequent response selection stage (e.g., Hommel, 1998). The former stage is thought to be influenced by both tasks and to be responsible for BCEs, whereas the latter stage implements the RSB suggested to explain many aspects of dual-task interference. The present experiments measured lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) to test predictions of this early response activation account. The results are generally consistent with a distinction between response selection and response activation, but they suggest that BCEs arise because second-task stimuli influence first-task response selection rather than because these stimuli activate the second-task responses with which they are associated. Thus, the results support an account of BCEs that is even more consistent with RSB models than previous accounts.},

Contrary to this conception, we found backward response-level crosstalk effects in which Task-2 response force requirements influenced the force-time dynamics of Task-1 responses. In two PRP experiments, Task 2 required a hard or soft key press response. Task-1 responses were harder when the upcoming Task-2 response was to press hard rather than soft, suggesting some activation of Task-2 response parameters before Task-1 processing reached the final ballistic stage of motor output. A third experiment using a single-task flankers paradigm showed that this effect did not arise from automatic activation of responses by the stimuli associated with hard and soft responses. This backward response-level crosstalk extends previous findings of backward crosstalk in the PRP paradigm by showing that crosstalk can affect motor output as well as response time and that such crosstalk can arise even when the two tasks being performed are not semantically related.},

Results suggest that expectancy and frequency have somewhat different effects on human information-processing mechanisms. Expectancy allows temporary preparation for a specific S pair in response selection processes, but it has no effect on perceptual processes. Stimulus frequency, on the other hand, influences the efficiency of both perceptual and response selection processes.

The usual finding of a "fast-same" phenomenon persisted even when irrelevant information was present. The similarity of the results in this task to results in the "same-different" task with no irrelevant features supports the idea that the same comparison mechanism is used whether or not irrelevant differences are present in the stimulus pairs. Results suggest a more general-purpose comparison mechanism than is usually included in models of this task. Two-process models of visual comparisons are thus ruled out entirely. A modified version of L. Krueger's (1970-1978) noisy-operator theory does appear consistent with the results.},

To see whether this compatibility effect reflects differential hand- versus foot-specific motor activation produced by the words, as suggested by some embodied theories of language understanding, we monitored two event-related potential (ERP) measures previously found to be sensitive to the activation of these limbs. As expected, the ERP results replicated previous findings that the monitored ERPs differ for hand versus foot movements. More importantly, the ERPs provided no evidence of any difference for hand- versus foot-associated words. Thus, the results weaken previous claims that the understanding of action verbs requires activation of the motor areas used to carry out the named action. Instead, they support claims that language-related compatibility effects on RT may arise prior to motor processes, which implies that such effects are not decisive evidence for embodied language understanding.},

Multitasking interference was present for task-repetition trials as well as task-alternation trials, so the interference could not be completely explained as a task-switching cost. In addition, responses to the primary task were influenced by their compatibility with the responses associated with the stimulus for the background task, indicating there was some activation of S-R associations within the background task even when this task did not require any response.

  abstract = {Four experiments examined whether well-established phenomena from the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm are also observed in the prioritized processing paradigm, as would be expected from a common description of the two paradigms with the response selection bottleneck (RSB) model. Consistent with a generalization of the RSB model to the prioritized processing paradigm, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that this paradigm yields effects of SOA and stimulus discriminability analogous to those observed in the PRP paradigm. In Experiments 3 and 4, however, overall RTs and effect sizes differed between the PRP and prioritized processing paradigms in ways that are difficult to explain within the RSB model. Understanding the differences between these two paradigms offers considerable promise as a way to extend the RSB model beyond the domain of the PRP paradigm and to generalize our understanding of multi-tasking interference.},

Simon effects were obtained in reaction time and force, with faster and more forceful components of the bimanual response with the hand on the same side as the lateralized stimulus as compared with the other hand. Also, Simon effects were larger when the lateralized target appeared alone than when it was accompanied by a distractor on the other side of the display. Finally, responses of the two hands were correlated most strongly when stimulus displays were symmetrical. We conclude that bimanual responses are strongly coupled but not perfectly so.},

By contrast, when stimuli varied only in size, no evidence for preliminary response preparation was obtained, contrary to an assumption of fully continuous models but consistent with asynchronous discrete coding models (J.

In Experiment 2 participants made bimanual responses, allowing measurement of the spatial congruence effect for each trial. Responses were both faster and more forceful with the spatially congruent hand than with the spatially incongruent one, but neither of these effects decreased for slower responses.

The model assumes that a detection criterion determines the level of sensory evidence needed to conclude that a stimulus has been presented. Analysis of the performance that would be achieved with different possible criterion settings reveals that performance is optimal using a lower criterion setting for the TOJ task than for the RT task. In addition, the model predicts that effects of stimulus manipulations should increase with the size of the detection criterion. Thus, the model suggests that commonly observed dissociations between RT and TOJ tasks may simply be due to performance optimization in the face of conflicting task demands.},

Within this model, we analyze the probability of successfully replicating an initial experimental result by obtaining either a statistically significant result in the same direction or by obtaining any effect in that direction. We analyze both the probability of successfully replicating a particular experimental effect (i.e., the _individual_ replication probability) and also the average probability of successful replication across different studies within some research context (i.e., the _aggregate_ replication probability), and we identify the conditions under which the latter can be approximated using the formulas of Killeen (2005a, 2007). We show how both of these probabilities depend on parameters of the research context that would rarely be known in practice. In addition, we show that the statistical uncertainty associated with the size of an initial observed effect would often prevent accurate estimation of the desired individual replication probability even if these research context parameters were known exactly. We conclude that accurate estimates of replication probability are generally unattainable.},

Given that a later event (i.e., conscious awareness) cannot cause an earlier one (i.e., decision-related brain activity), such results have been interpreted as evidence that decisions are made unconsciously (e.g., Libet, 1985). We argue that this interpretation depends upon an all-or-none view of consciousness, and we offer an alternative interpretation of the early decision-related brain activity based on models in which conscious awareness of the decision to move develops gradually up to the level of a reporting criterion. Under this interpretation, the early brain activity reflects sub-criterion levels of awareness rather than complete absence of awareness and thus does not suggest that decisions are made unconsciously.},

Specifically, even though an experimental manipulation might have no effect on average across individuals, it might still have demonstrable effects---albeit in opposite directions---for many or all of the individuals tested. We discuss several examples of research questions for which it would be theoretically crucial to determine whether manipulations really have no effect at the individual level, and we present a method of testing for individual-level effects.},

In Experiment 1 with simultaneous go stimuli in the two tasks, responses appeared to be grouped in approximately 75--80% of trials, compared with nearly 100% grouping in a single-task condition requiring bimanual responses to the onset of any stimulus in either modality. In Experiment 2 with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 0--400 msec between the two go stimuli, response grouping clearly declined as SOA increased, although some grouping was still evident even at the longest SOA. The same pattern was observed in Experiment 3 with the same range of SOAs but unpredictable stimulus order, suggesting that grouping is not strongly dependent on prior knowledge of the likely response order. These results emphasize the pervasiveness of response grouping in bimanual dual-task RT paradigms and provide useful clues as to its nature.},

Given certain necessary information about a research area, the model can be used to determine the optimal values of sample size, statistical power, rate of false positives, rate of false negatives, and replicability, such that overall research payoff is maximized. More specifically, the model shows how the optimal values of these quantities depend upon the size and frequency of true effects within the area, as well as the individual payoffs associated with particular study outcomes. The model is particularly relevant within current discussions of how to optimize the productivity of scientific research, because it shows which aspects of a research area must be considered and how these aspects combine to determine total research payoff.},

In most fields, $\alpha=0.05$ has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as $\alpha=0.01$, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal $\alpha$ level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although $\alpha=0.05$ would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal $\alpha$ could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one $\alpha$ level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular $\alpha$ level.},

We also studied inverted-U-shaped or ``bump-like'' components. Jackknifing generally yielded smaller error variances with these components too, especially when the component's peak amplitude varied across participants, but less so if the component's peak latency varied.

  abstract = {We conducted two multitasking experiments to examine the finding that first-task RTs are slower in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm than in the prioritized processing (PP) paradigm. To see whether this difference between the two paradigms could be explained entirely by differences in first-task preparation, which would be consistent with the standard response selection bottleneck (RSB) model for multitasking interference, we compared the size of this difference for trials in which a second-task stimulus actually occurred against the size of the difference for trials without any second-task stimulus. The slowing of first-task RTs in the PRP paradigm relative to the PP paradigm was larger when the second-task stimulus appeared than when it did not, indicating that the difference cannot be explained entirely by between-paradigm differences in first-task preparation. Instead, the results suggest that the slowing of first-task RTs in the PRP paradigm relative to the PP paradigm is partly due to differences between paradigms in the on-line reallocation of processing capacity to tasks. Thus, the present results provide new evidence supporting resource models over the RSB model.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we tested the idea that relevant and irrelevant location-based activations are combined when selecting a response in the Simon task. For this purpose, we manipulated the strength of the relevant activation by using single versus redundant relevant stimuli to indicate the correct response. Assuming that relevant and irrelevant activations are summed during the decision process, the Simon effect should be reduced in the presence of the stronger relevant activation produced by redundant stimuli. Contrary to this expectation, the results revealed that the Simon effect was larger overall with redundant stimuli than with single stimuli. Importantly, distributional analyses indicated that the Simon effect was not reduced for redundant stimuli even when controlling for the opportunity for irrelevant location activation to dissipate after stimulus onset. These results are thus inconsistent with accounts in which the summation of decision-level activations is the cause of the Simon effect. Instead, these results are consistent with the idea that redundancy and irrelevant location information influence activations at different levels. Considering the findings of previous studies, the most likely account is that redundancy affects decision-level activations whereas relevant and irrelevant activation are integrated at the motor level to produce the Simon effect (i.e., decision locus of redundancy gain and motor locus of Simon effect).},

Consistent with fading activation accounts, the Simon effect on mean RT was usually smaller for conditions with slower responses (Expts. 1-3 but not Expt. 4), and delta plot analyses revealed that it was always smaller for the slower responses within each condition. Critically, however, these analyses also revealed that some experimental manipulations produced upward or downward shifts in the RT delta plots, thus altering the Simon effect on mean RT in ways that could not be explained by fading activation. The results demonstrate the power of combining RT distributional analyses with experimental manipulations to reveal mechanisms contributing to the Simon effect that would not be revealed using only mean RT. We consider alternatives to fading activation accounts of decreasing delta plots and discuss the contribution of different cognitive stages in modulating Simon effects.},

Instead of instructing participants to randomly switch between tasks as in the classic voluntary task switching paradigm (Arrington & Logan, 2004), we instructed participants to optimize their task performance in a voluntary task switching environment in which the stimulus associated with the previously selected task appeared delayed in each trial. Importantly, the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) increased further with each additional repetition of this task, whereas the stimulus needed for a task switch was always immediately available. We conducted two experiments with different SOA increments (i.e., Exp. 1a. = 50 ms, Exp. 1b = 33 ms) to see whether this procedure would induce switching behavior, and we explored how people trade off switch costs against the increasing availability of the stimulus needed for a task repetition. We observed that participants adapted their behavior to the different task environments (i.e., SOA increments) and that participants switched tasks when the SOA in task switches approximately matched switch costs. Moreover, correlational analyses indicated relations between individual switch costs and individual switch rates across participants. Together, these results demonstrate that participants were sensitive to the increased availability of switch stimuli in deciding whether to switch or repeat, which in turn demonstrates flexible adaptive task selection behavior. We suggest that performance limitations in task switching interact with the task environment to influence switching behavior.},

In the present study, we used an adaptive VTS paradigm to directly test whether and how people adapt to these two constraints when they are instructed to optimize their task performance. In five experiments, the availabilities of stimuli for two tasks in a trial changed predictably because the stimulus needed for a task repetition appeared with an SOA that increased linearly with the number of repetitions. Experiments 1a and 1b demonstrated that stimulus availability did not automatically induce switching behavior. Experiment 2 showed that the predictable external constraints were accommodated in participants' switching behavior once participants overcame their reluctance to switch tasks. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that both switch costs and switch rates were influenced by manipulating the time between trials. Moreover, switch costs and switch rates were correlated across all experiments; and when the time for advanced preparation of task selection was limited (Experiment 1a, 1b, and certain conditions of Experiments 3 and 4), the SOA in task switches approximately matched switch costs. Together, these results point to a link between task selection and performance indicating that participants adapt their task selection behavior to mutual effects of external and internal influences on task performance. We propose that both task selection and task performance can be integrated within a framework of competing multiple task-set activations.},

  abstract = {The traditional explanation for dual-task interference is that tasks compete for scarce processing resources. Another possible explanation is that the outcome of the processing required for one task conflicts with the processing required for the other task (e.g., cross talk). To explore the contribution of outcome conflict to task interference, we manipulated the relatedness of the tasks. In Experiment 1, subjects searched concurrently for names of boys in one channel and names of cities in another channel. Responses were significantly delayed when nontarget on one channel belonged to, or was even just related to, the category designated as the target for the other channel. No comparable effects were found when the tasks were performed in isolation. Thus, the difficulty of the individual tasks is not the only determinant of how much they will interfere when combined, and there must be substantial interactions between processes carrying out the two tasks. In Experiment 2 subjects searched one channel for specific target letters and another channel for specific target digits. The nontargets in a channel were either from the same alphanumeric category as the targets for that channel or from the opposite category (i.e., the category of the targets for the other channel). It was found that although between-category search was more efficient than within-category search in single tasks, it was less efficient in dual tasks.},

  abstract = {The model of a single central bottleneck for human information processing is critically examined. Most evidence cited in support of the model has been observed within the overlapping tasks paradigm. It is shown here that most findings obtained within that paradigm and that were used to support the model are also consistent with a simple resource model. The most prominent findings are the millisecond-for-millisecond slope at the left of the RT2-SOA curve, the high RT1-RT2 correlation, the additivity of the effects on RT2 of SOA and of the difficulty of selecting R2, and the washout of the effect of S2 discriminability on RT2 in a dual-task condition. In addition, the asymmetry of the effects of the dual-task requirement on RT1 and RT2 can be accounted for by the resource model provided that it assumes uneven allocation of resources, which is quite reasonable in view of the task asymmetry inherent in the demand characteristics of the paradigm. The same is true for two other findings that appear to support the single-bottleneck model, that in the dual-task condition, the demand of the first task affects equally RT1 and RT2, and that its effect on RT1 is the same as the corresponding effect in the single-task condition. Furthermore, the single-bottleneck model is hard to reconcile with a negative slope at the left of the RT1-SOA curve or a positive slope at the left of the IRI-SOA curve, unless augmented by ancillary assumptions that are yet to be substantiated. Representative data were fit by each of the models using its optimal set of parameters. Both models achieved quite good degrees of fit. It is further argued that since the overlapping tasks paradigm is heavily biased in favor of a speedy reaction to the stimulus that appears first, it is non-optimal for testing the central bottleneck model. Finally, the bottleneck model is examined in terms of other scientific criteria.},

Manipulations of sensory and attentional factors were assessed for both measures. We found a normal CUD (3.8 ms) along with an exacerbated and more variable asynchrony for partial split-brain individuals (40.8 ms) compared to normal individuals (CUD: 0.4 ms, asynchrony: 13.8 ms). In turn, the CUD of total split-brain individuals (20.4 ms) was larger than that of partial split-brain and normal individuals. Also, the asynchrony of total split-brain individuals (57.6 ms) was larger and more variable than that of normal individuals, and more variable than that of partial split-brain individuals. We interpret these results as behavioural evidence of independent mechanisms underlying the CUD and bimanual synchronization, as well as evidence of the joint involvement of both the anterior and posterior portions of the corpus callosum in bimanual coordination.},

Total split-brain individuals showed a tendency toward larger RTEs with the luminance stimuli than with the colour and motion stimuli, whereas this was not the case for partial split-brain individuals, suggesting a contribution of the posterior portion of the corpus callosum in the RTE.

Contrast had a main effect but did not interact with probability at any level of processing. In Exp III, Ss were switched to the physical level of processing. Stimuli that had the same name but differed in case were called different. In this condition, the probability effects observed in Exp II disappeared. These results are interpreted as demonstrating that stimulus probability has its effects during the process that derives the name of the stimulus from the visual representation.

Experiment 1 was a reanalysis of Cousineau and Shiffrin's data, for which a mixture effect had previously been established by a bimodal distribution of RTs, and the results confirmed that the likelihood ratio test could also detect this mixture.

Specifically, we analyzed data from experiments comparing hand vs. foot responses--presumably differing in the motor stage--and from experiments in which the lateralized readiness potential was used to localize experimental effects into premotor vs. motor processes. Moreover, we broadened the scope to two other descriptive RT models: the ex-Wald and EZ diffusion models. To the extent possible with each of these models, we reanalyzed the RT data of 19 clearly localized experimental effects from 12 separate experiments reported in seven previously published articles. Unfortunately, we did not find a clear pattern of results for any of the models, with no clear link between effects on one of the model's parameters and effects on different processing stages.

The results indicated that the backward crosstalk effect was mainly driven by a stimulus-based compatibility, as indicated by a significant S2-R1 compatibility effect in the matched and reversed conditions, with little change in this effect between the matched and reversed conditions.  Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings to a psychological refractory period paradigm. The present findings suggest that in the matched and reversed conditions, there was only one S-R rule active at a time.},

If mental rotation of the stimulus letter can proceed while central mechanisms are busy with S-sub-1, then the effect of orientation should decrease substantially with decreasing SOA. Contrary to these predictions, the effect of orientation was nearly constant across SOAs, suggesting that mental rotation cannot effectively proceed without help from central mechanisms. These results support the conclusion that mental rotation requires access to a single-channel mechanism and must therefore be performed serially with other operations requiring the same mechanism.},

The present study investigated to what extent temporal preparation involves increased readiness for task-specific processing requirements as opposed to increased task-independent readiness. Participants performed either a pitch, a letter, or a color discrimination task within a variable foreperiod paradigm and tasks alternated regularly between auditory and visual discriminations. In separate blocks of trials, the upcoming visual discrimination task was either predictable or unpredictable. We observed the standard variable foreperiod effect for both visual discrimination tasks irrespective of task predictability. Importantly, however, the variable foreperiod effect was larger when the visual discrimination task was predictable than when it was unpredictable. These results suggest that temporal preparation in choice reaction time tasks involves increased readiness for both task-independent and task-specific processing requirements.},

Redundant stimulation resulted in two separate percepts when non-corresponding retinal areas were stimulated, whereas it resulted in a single fused percept when corresponding areas were stimulated. With stimulation of non-corresponding areas, mean RT was shorter to redundant than to single stimulation, replicating the redundant signals effect (RSE) commonly found with visual stimuli. With stimulation of corresponding areas, however, no RSE was observed. This suggests that the RSE is driven by the number of percepts rather than by the number of stimulated receptors or sensory organs. These results are consistent with previous findings in the auditory modality and have implications for models of the RSE.},

In Experiment 2 with a pure tone and white noise as the two stimulus alternatives, RSEs were found for responding to both onsets and offsets.

The results extend previous findings of redundancy gains and coactivation with visual and bimodal stimuli to the auditory modality. Furthermore, at least within this modality, the results indicate that redundancy gains do not emerge when redundant stimuli are integrated into a single percept.},

We describe and analyze five classes of well-established latency mechanisms which are consistent with nDPs: exhaustive processing models, correlated stage models, mixture models, cascade models, and parallel channels models, and discuss the implications of our analyses for the interpretation of DPs.

  abstract = {Many perceptual and cognitive tasks permit or require the integrated cooperation of specialized sensory channels, detectors, or other functionally separate units. In compound detection or discrimination tasks, one prominent general mechanism to model the combination of the output of different processing channels is probability summation. The classical example is the binocular summation model of Pirenne (1943), according to which a weak visual stimulus is detected if at least one of the two eyes detects this stimulus; as we review briefly, exactly the same reasoning is applied in numerous other fields. It is generally accepted that this mechanism necessarily predicts performance based on two (or more) channels to be superior to single channel performance because two separate channels provide "two chances" to succeed with the task. We argue that this reasoning is misleading because it neglects the increased opportunity with two channels not just for hits but also for false alarms, and that there may well be no redundancy gain at all when performance is measured in terms of ROC curves. We illustrate and support these arguments with a visual detection experiment involving different spatial uncertainty conditions. Our arguments and findings have important implications for all models which, in one way or another, rest on, or incorporate, the notion of probability summation for the analysis of detection tasks, 2AFC tasks, and psychometric functions.},

We conducted three experiments aimed at determining (a) whether a redundancy gain would be evident in a task unambiguously requiring higher level processing (the semantic categorisation of visually-presented lexical stimuli), and (b) if so, what accounts might be appropriate to explain such findings. We found that redundancy gains are observed in such tasks, and we conclude that both coactivation and race models can account for these gains.},

We asked undergraduate psychology students to complete choice RT tasks requiring the semantic categorisation of visually-presented words, and compared performance with redundant targets from the same semantic category to performance with redundant targets from different semantic categories. If the redundancy gains resulted from the combination of information at a semantic level, they should have been greater in the former than the latter situation. However, our results showed no significant differences in redundancy gain (for latency and accuracy) between same-category and different-category conditions, despite gains appearing in both conditions. Thus, we suggest that redundancy gain in the semantic categorisation task may result entirely from statistical facilitation or combination of information at non-semantic levels.},

Although a clear foreperiod LRP was obtained, its amplitude was insensitive to the movement conditions. Therefore, Experiment 2 assessed whether effects of movement complexity depend on the precision of the required movement. However, we observed larger LRP amplitudes to complex than to simple movements under both stringent and lenient response conditions, ruling out an explanation in terms of required movement precision. Possible explanations for the inconsistency of the complexity effects on the foreperiod LRP are discussed.},

The current paper describes two experiments in which we attempted to replicate Libet et al.'s comparison of participants' movement-related brain activity with the reported times of their decisions to move and also the reported times of their decisions of which hand to move. We also looked at the distribution of participants' reports over time to evaluate an alternative explanation of Libet et al.'s (1983) results. Although the Readiness Potential was usually present before all of the decisions to move, consistent with the findings of Keller and Heckhausen (1990) and Libet et al. (1983), we found that many reported decision-times were before the onset of the Lateralized Readiness Potential, which measures hand-specific movement preparation. The latter finding is consistent with the conclusion that the LRP always started after the conscious decision to move. We conclude that even though activity related to movement anticipation may be present before a conscious decision to move, the cortical preparation necessary for the movement to happen immediately may not start until after the conscious decision to move.},

Exps 1 and 2 compared simple with choice tasks in 36 Ss (mean age 26.3 and 27.7 yrs, respectively) with results showing that response force was virtually identical for the simple and choice RT tasks.

  abstract = {Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014) have suggested a novel test to detect p-hacking in research, that is, when researchers report excessive rates of "significant effects" that are truly false positives. Although this test is very useful for identifying true effects in some cases, it fails to identify false positives in several situations when researchers conduct multiple statistical tests (e.g., reporting the most significant result). In these cases, p-curves are right-skewed, thereby mimicking the existence of real effects even if no effect is actually present.},

  abstract = {p-curves provide a useful window for peeking into the file drawer in a way that might reveal p-hacking (Simonsohn,2014,JEPG). The properties of p-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of these simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be used as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p-values within a certain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually demonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous mathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined without simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any statistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough evaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions p-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition, we used weighted distribution functions to analyze how two different types of publication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence the shapes of p-curves. The results of two survey experiments with more than 1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p=0.05 and also suggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of a manuscript as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level. This gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of real effects even when no such effects are actually present.},

  abstract = {Publication bias hampers the estimation of true effect sizes. Specifically, effect sizes are systematically overestimated when studies report only significant results. In this paper we show how this overestimation depends on the true effect size and on the sample size. Furthermore, we review and follow up methods originally suggested by Hedges (1984), Iyengar and Greenhouse (1988), and Rust, Lehmann, and Farley (1990) allowing the estimation of the true effect size from published test statistics (e.g., from the t-values of reported significant results). Moreover, we adapted these methods allowing meta-analysts to estimate the percentage of researchers who consign undesired results in a research domain to the file drawer. We also apply the same logic to the case when significant results tend to be underreported. We demonstrate the application of these procedures for conventional one-sample and two-sample t-tests. Finally, we provide R and MATLAB versions of a computer program to estimate the true unbiased effect size and the prevalence of publication bias in the literature.},

Raab (1962) suggested an account of this redundant-targets effect in terms of a race model in which the response to redundant target stimuli is initiated by the faster of two separate target detection processes. Such models make a prediction about the probability distributions of reaction times often called the "race model inequality," and it is often of interest to test this prediction. In this article, we describe a precise algorithm that can be used to test the race model inequality, and we present a Pascal program and MatLab routines implementing this algorithm.},

  abstract = {Previous research indicates that response force increases with stimulus intensity in simple reaction time (SRT) tasks. This result contradicts the common view that the perceptual system activates the motor system via a punctate go signal of fixed size. An elaborated view assumes that the size of the go signal depends on stimulus intensity so that more intense stimuli yield more forceful responses. In order to examine the latter hypothesis, the present experiments manipulated stimulus duration as well as intensity. Response force increased with duration even beyond a critical value of about 60 ms at which stimulus duration no longer affected SRT. In addition, increasing the duration of a stimulus also increased the duration of force output. These findings argue against models with punctate transmission of activation to the motor system. Certain continuous models and variable output models with prolonged go signals provide acceptable accounts of these effects.},

The participants' task was to discriminate whether a target letter within a rapid sequence appeared in its upper or lower case version, and an advance cue indicated the color in which the target letter was most likely to occur. To maximize the usefulness of the cued color, we used sequences in which the target was the only item appearing in the cued color in validly cued trials. In both experiments, accuracy was highest for validly cued trials. Cost-benefit analysis revealed a facilitory effect of valid cues and an inhibitory effect of invalid ones. These results support the idea that color cuing allows the direct selection of objects for further perceptual processing.},

Participants were required to respond to the presence or case of a target letter presented within an RSVP sequence, and they were cued as to the color in which that target was most likely to occur. The first two experiments explored the effect of task difficulty. It was found that a change from discrimination of upper versus lower case targets to detection of an exact shape had no influence on the color cuing effect. In contrast, increasing letter set discriminability and decreasing color discriminability reduced the color cuing effect considerably, although they did not eliminate it. In the third and fourth experiments the frequency of valid trials was reduced, removing the incentive to use the color information. Again, a small benefit remained, indicating partially automatic and strategic color processing components. Finally, the fifth experiment showed that an increase in perceptual load had no influence on the color cuing effect. Together, these five experiments provide further evidence of the robustness of direct selection by color.},

  abstract = {Two of the possible mechanisms that have been put forward to explain precuing effects are signal enhancement and uncertainty reduction. Signal enhancement leads to processing advantages for valid information because the signal at the known input channel is enhanced, whereas uncertainty reduction allows observers to ignore confusing distractor items in a display. Both mechanisms have been reported to be involved in location precuing, but it is still unclear which of these two mechanisms is responsible for color cuing effects. Two experiments are reported in which expectancy for a certain color in a single-item display was created. Targets were presented briefly and masked. If color cues produce signal enhancement, then a color cuing effect should result. If color cues only allow uncertainty reduction, however, there should be no color cuing effect because there are no distractors in single-item displays. The results of both experiments favor uncertainty reduction as the mechanism behind color cuing, because no signs of signal enhancement-based cueing effects were observed.},

Replicating Vierck and Miller (2005), upper/lower case discrimination accuracy was higher following valid than invalid color cues. Within the ERPs, the target onset produced a negative component between 150 and 350 ms at occipital sites, with shorter latencies following valid than invalid cues. We also found larger amplitude components for valid than invalid color cues at central and parietal sites between 150 and 325 ms. The results not only demonstrate clear effects of color cuing on both behaviour and ERPs but also suggest that the observed ERP differences between valid versus invalid trials mediate the behavioural effects.},

  abstract = {Selection in multiple item displays has been shown to benefit immensely from advance knowledge of target location (e.g., Henderson, 1991), leading to the suggestion that location is completely dominant in visual selective attention (e.g., Tsal \& Lavie, 1993). Recently, direct selection by color has been reported in displays where location does not vary (Vierck \& Miller, 2005). The present experiment investigated the possibility of independent selection by color in a task with multiple item displays and location precues to see whether color is also used for selection even when target location does vary and supposedly dominant location precues can be used. Precues provided independent information about the location and color of a target, and each type of precue could be either valid or invalid. The precues were followed by brief displays of six letters in six different colors, and participants had to discriminate the case of a prespecified target letter (e.g., R versus r). Performance was much better when location cues were valid than when they were invalid, confirming the large advantage associated with valid advance location information. Performance was also better with valid advance color information, however, both when location cues were valid and when they were invalid. But these color benefits were dependent on the closeness of the colored letter to the cued location, our results thus suggest that selection by color in a multiple item display, where location and color information was independent from each other and equalized, is mediated by location information.},

ERPs elicited by cued-color distractors were similar to those elicited by targets indicating relatively complete processing of such distractors. In the second experiment one of the letters in the RSVP sequence was framed by an irrelevant distractor probe in either the cued color or an uncued color. The distractor probes in this experiment elicited a P1, N1, P2 sequence that depended on their color. In addition, probes presented shortly before the target tended to suppress the ERP components associated with target processing, especially for probes in the cued color. The results demonstrate electrophysiological consequences of attentional selection and capture by color.},
