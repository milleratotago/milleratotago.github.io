N2  - In two experiments, we used rapid serial visual presentation tasks to examine the usefulness of color for the direct selection of visual information for perceptual encoding. The participants ́task was to discriminate whether a target letter within a rapid sequence appeared in its upper or lower case version, and an advance cue indicated the color in which the target letter was most likely to occur. To maximize the usefulness of the cued color, we used sequences in which the target was the only item appearing in the cued color in validly cued trials. In both experiments, accuracy was highest for validly cued trials. Cost-benefit analysis revealed a facilitory effect of valid cues and an inhibitory effect of invalid ones. These results support the idea that color cuing allows the direct selection of objects for further perceptual processing.

N2  - Five experiments examined task factors influencing selection by color in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Participants were required to respond to the presence or case of a target letter presented within an RSVP sequence, and they were cued as to the color in which that target was most likely to occur. The first two experiments explored the effect of task difficulty. It was found that a change from discrimination of upper versus lower case targets to detection of an exact shape had no influence on the color cuing effect. In contrast, increasing letter set discriminability and decreasing color discriminability reduced the color cuing effect considerably, although they did not eliminate it. In the third and fourth experiments the frequency of valid trials was reduced, removing the incentive to use the color information. Again, a small benefit remained, indicating partially automatic and strategic color processing components. Finally, the fifth experiment showed that an increase in perceptual load had no influence on the color cuing effect. Together, these five experiments provide further evidence of the robustness of direct selection by color.

N2  - Two of the possible mechanisms that have been put forward to explain precuing effects are signal enhancement and uncertainty reduction. Signal enhancement leads to processing advantages for valid information because the signal at the known input channel is enhanced, whereas uncertainty reduction allows observers to ignore confusing distractor items in a display. Both mechanisms have been reported to be involved in location precuing, but it is still unclear which of these two mechanisms is responsible for color cuing effects. Two experiments are reported in which expectancy for a certain color in a single-item display was created. Targets were presented briefly and masked. If color cues produce signal enhancement, then a color cuing effect should result. If color cues only allow uncertainty reduction, however, there should be no color cuing effect because there are no distractors in single-item displays. The results of both experiments favor uncertainty reduction as the mechanism behind color cuing, because no signs of signal enhancement-based cueing effects were observed.

N2  - We report an experiment using event-related potentials (ERPs) to study selection by color uncontaminated from selection by location. Participants monitored an RSVP sequence for a given target letter that could appear in upper or lower case. Prior to the sequence, a cue indicated the most likely color of the target letter. Replicating Vierck and Miller (2005), upper/lower case discrimination accuracy was higher following valid than invalid color cues. Within the ERPs, the target onset produced a negative component between 150 and 350 ms at occipital sites, with shorter latencies following valid than invalid cues. We also found larger amplitude components for valid than invalid color cues at central and parietal sites between 150 and 325 ms. The results not only demonstrate clear effects of color cuing on both behaviour and ERPs but also suggest that the observed ERP differences between valid versus invalid trials mediate the behavioural effects.

N2  - Selection in multiple item displays has been shown to benefit immensely from advance knowledge of target location (e.g., Henderson, 1991), leading to the suggestion that location is completely dominant in visual selective attention (e.g., Tsal & Lavie, 1993). Recently, direct selection by color has been reported in displays where location does not vary (Vierck & Miller, 2005). The present experiment investigated the possibility of independent selection by color in a task with multiple item displays and location precues to see whether color is also used for selection even when target location does vary and supposedly dominant location precues can be used. Precues provided independent information about the location and color of a target, and each type of precue could be either valid or invalid. The precues were followed by brief displays of six letters in six different colors, and participants had to discriminate the case of a prespecified target letter (e.g., R versus r). Performance was much better when location cues were valid than when they were invalid, confirming the large advantage associated with valid advance location information. Performance was also better with valid advance color information, however, both when location cues were valid and when they were invalid. But these color benefits were dependent on the closeness of the colored letter to the cued location, our results thus suggest that selection by color in a multiple item display, where location and color information was independent from each other and equalized, is mediated by location information.

N2  - We investigated the effects of different types of colored distractors on early ERPs. We expected variation in ERPs depending on the distractorś type and its distance from the target to reveal the psychophysiological consequences of selection by color. In the first experiment participants searched an RSVP sequence for a prespecified target letter that was likely to appear in a cued color. ERPs elicited by cued-color distractors were similar to those elicited by targets indicating relatively complete processing of such distractors. In the second experiment one of the letters in the RSVP sequence was framed by an irrelevant distractor probe in either the cued color or an uncued color. The distractor probes in this experiment elicited a P1, N1, P2 sequence that depended on their color. In addition, probes presented shortly before the target tended to suppress the ERP components associated with target processing, especially for probes in the cued color. The results demonstrate electrophysiological consequences of attentional selection and capture by color.

N2  - Previous research indicates that response force increases with stimulus intensity in simple reaction time (SRT) tasks. This result contradicts the common view that the perceptual system activates the motor system via a punctate go signal of fixed size. An elaborated view assumes that the size of the go signal depends on stimulus intensity so that more intense stimuli yield more forceful responses. In order to examine the latter hypothesis, the present experiments manipulated stimulus duration as well as intensity. Response force increased with duration even beyond a critical value of about 60 ms at which stimulus duration no longer affected SRT. In addition, increasing the duration of a stimulus also increased the duration of force output. These findings argue against models with punctate transmission of activation to the motor system. Certain continuous models and variable output models with prolonged go signals provide acceptable accounts of these effects.

N2  - In divided attention tasks, responses are faster when two redundant target stimuli are presented than when only a single target stimulus is presented. Raab (1962) suggested an account of this redundant-targets effect in terms of a race model in which the response to redundant target stimuli is initiated by the faster of two separate target detection processes. Such models make a prediction about the probability distributions of reaction times often called the "race model inequality," and it is often of interest to test this prediction. In this article, we describe a precise algorithm that can be used to test the race model inequality, and we present a Pascal program and MatLab routines implementing this algorithm.

N2  - Publication bias hampers the estimation of true effect sizes. Specifically, effect sizes are systematically overestimated when studies report only significant results. In this paper we show how this overestimation depends on the true effect size and on the sample size. Furthermore, we review and follow up methods originally suggested by Hedges (1984), Iyengar and Greenhouse (1988), and Rust, Lehmann, and Farley (1990) allowing the estimation of the true effect size from published test statistics (e.g., from the t-values of reported significant results). Moreover, we adapted these methods allowing meta-analysts to estimate the percentage of researchers who consign undesired results in a research domain to the file drawer. We also apply the same logic to the case when significant results tend to be underreported. We demonstrate the application of these procedures for conventional one-sample and two-sample t-tests. Finally, we provide R and MATLAB versions of a computer program to estimate the true unbiased effect size and the prevalence of publication bias in the literature.

Thus, the lognormal has the status of an ad hoc distribution in RT research. The authors describe mechanisms that could generate the lognormal distribution and show how specific RT models can be constructed within the framework of general mathematical properties of the lognormal. It is demonstrated that various conceptually different mechanisms could produce lognormally distributed RTs.

N2  - Many reaction time (RT) researchers truncate their data sets, excluding as spurious all RTs falling outside a prespecified range. Such truncation can introduce bias because extreme but valid RTs may be excluded. This article examines biasing effects of truncation under various assumptions about the underlying distributions of valid and spurious RTs. For the mean, median, standard deviation and skewness of RT, truncation bias is larger than some often-studied experimental effects. Truncation can also seriously distort linear relations between RT and an independent variable, additive RT patterns in factorial designs, and hazard functions, but it has little effect on statistical power. A promising maximum likelihood procedure for estimating properties of an untruncated distribution from a truncated sample is reported, and a set of procedures to control for truncation biases when testing hypotheses is appended.

This new test will not only strengthen the interpretation of SOA effects on RT but might also provide a convenient theoretical reference point for the development and comparison of alternative model classes.

The present paper generalizes such jackknife-based methods to factorial experiments with any combination of within- and between subjects factors. Specifically, we introduce a subsample scoring method to assess potential main and interaction effects on LRP onsets within conventional yet slightly adjusted analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and post-hoc comparison procedures.

N2  - The Spearman-Karber method can be used to estimate the threshold value or difference limen in two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) tasks. This method yields a simple estimator for the difference limen and its standard error, such that both can be calculated with a pocket calculator. In contrast to previous estimators, the present approach does not require any assumptions about the shape of the true underlying psychometric function. The performance of this new nonparametric estimator is compared with the standard technique of probit analysis. The Spearman-Karber method was found to have excellent statistical properties and thus to be a valuable addition to the toolbox of psychophysical methods for the analysis of 2AFC tasks.

N2  - Response grouping is a ubiquitous phenomenon in psychological refractory period (PRP) tasks, yet it hampers the analysis of dual-task performance. To account for response grouping, we developed several extended versions of the standard bottleneck model, each of which incorporates a possible grouping mechanism into this model. Computer simulations were used to assess how the predictions of the standard model would change with each grouping mechanism. One set of simulations investigated the basic effects of grouping on the means and intercorrelation of the reaction times in the two tasks, as well as the percentage of trials with short interresponse times (IRTs). A second set of simulations examined whether response grouping would invalidate the use of PRP paradigms for localizing experimental effects. Finally, we investigated whether the post-hoc elimination of trials with short IRTs removes the contaminating effects of response grouping.

N2  - Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014) have suggested a novel test to detect p-hacking in research, that is, when researchers report excessive rates of "significant effects" that are truly false positives. Although this test is very useful for identifying true effects in some cases, it fails to identify false positives in several situations when researchers conduct multiple statistical tests (e.g., reporting the most significant result). In these cases, p-curves are right-skewed, thereby mimicking the existence of real effects even if no effect is actually present.

N2  - p-curves provide a useful window for peeking into the file drawer in a way that might reveal p-hacking (Simonsohn,2014,JEPG). The properties of p-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of these simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be used as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p-values within a certain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually demonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous mathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined without simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any statistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough evaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions p-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition, we used weighted distribution functions to analyze how two different types of publication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence the shapes of p-curves. The results of two survey experiments with more than 1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p=0.05 and also suggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of a manuscript as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level. This gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of real effects even when no such effects are actually present.

N2  - In order to assess F. C. Dondersś (1868/1969) assumption of pure insertion for the response execution stage, we measured the magnitude and time course of response force in 3 classical reaction time (RT) tasks: simple RT, go/nogo and 2-choice RT. In each trial, we measured the complete force-time profile of the response. Exps 1 and 2 compared simple with choice tasks in 36 Ss (mean age 26.3 and 27.7 yrs, respectively) with results showing that response force was virtually identical for the simple and choice RT tasks. Exp 3 compared choice with go/nogo tasks in 36 Ss (mean age 25.4 yrs) and found that the go/nogo task yielded more forceful responses. Exp 4 was identical to Exp 3 except that the choice task was replaced by the simple RT task. Results from 36 Ss (mean age 26.6 yrs) indicate that more forceful responses were produced in the go/nogo task. Exp 5 examined the focusing of attention in the go/nogo task as compared to the choice task. Ss produced larger force amplitudes in the go/nogo task. These results support Dondersś original assumption that the response execution process operates identically in the simple and choice RT tasks. More response activation seems to be generated in the go/nogo task, however, consistent with a motor readiness model.

Contrary to the asynchronous discrete coding model, these results suggest that the perceptual system may transmit to the response system information that only partially specifies a single stimulus attribute. In combination with previous findings, these results also suggest that there are at least two dissociable forms of selective preparation for a given response.

N2  - The idea that our conscious decisions determine our actions has been challenged by a report suggesting that the brain starts to prepare for a movement before the person concerned has consciously decided to move (Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983). Libet et al. claimed that their results show that our actions are not consciously initiated. The current paper describes two experiments in which we attempted to replicate Libet et al.ś comparison of participants ́movement-related brain activity with the reported times of their decisions to move and also the reported times of their decisions of which hand to move. We also looked at the distribution of participants ́reports over time to evaluate an alternative explanation of Libet et al.ś (1983) results. Although the Readiness Potential was usually present before all of the decisions to move, consistent with the findings of Keller and Heckhausen (1990) and Libet et al. (1983), we found that many reported decision-times were before the onset of the Lateralized Readiness Potential, which measures hand-specific movement preparation. The latter finding is consistent with the conclusion that the LRP always started after the conscious decision to move. We conclude that even though activity related to movement anticipation may be present before a conscious decision to move, the cortical preparation necessary for the movement to happen immediately may not start until after the conscious decision to move.

N2  - Benjamin Libet has argued that electrophysiological signs of cortical movement preparation are present before people report having made a conscious decision to move, and that these signs constitute evidence that voluntary movements are initiated unconsciously. This controversial conclusion depends critically on the assumption that the electrophysiological signs recorded by Libet, Gleason, Wright, and Pearl (1983) are associated only with preparation for movement. We tested that assumption by comparing the electrophysiological signs before a decision to move with signs present before a decision not to move. There was no evidence of stronger electrophysiological signs before a decision to move than before a decision not to move, so these signs clearly are not specific to movement preparation. We conclude that Libetś results do not provide evidence that voluntary movements are initiated unconsciously.

N2  - Hackley and Miller (1995) reported that complex sequences of finger movements are preceded by larger LRP amplitudes than simple finger flexions. The present study seeks to assess this LRP enhancement in more detail. Experiment 1 included two further conditions requiring either repeated movements with one and the same finger or simultaneous movements with three fingers. Although a clear foreperiod LRP was obtained, its amplitude was insensitive to the movement conditions. Therefore, Experiment 2 assessed whether effects of movement complexity depend on the precision of the required movement. However, we observed larger LRP amplitudes to complex than to simple movements under both stringent and lenient response conditions, ruling out an explanation in terms of required movement precision. Possible explanations for the inconsistency of the complexity effects on the foreperiod LRP are discussed.

We developed a model of single-trial LRP waveforms that produces realistic average waveforms for both stimulus-locked and response-locked averaging. This model may be useful in computer simulation studies of LRP scoring methods, and it may open up the possibility of ultimately retrieving trial-by-trial information about LRP activity.

N2  - Redundancy gain refers to the performance enhancements often associated with the presentation of redundant versus single targets (for example, faster, more accurate, or more forceful responses). Though predominantly observed in relatively simple tasks (e.g., stimulus detection), there have been some efforts to investigate similar phenomena in tasks involving higher level processing. We conducted three experiments aimed at determining (a) whether a redundancy gain would be evident in a task unambiguously requiring higher level processing (the semantic categorisation of visually-presented lexical stimuli), and (b) if so, what accounts might be appropriate to explain such findings. We found that redundancy gains are observed in such tasks, and we conclude that both coactivation and race models can account for these gains.

We asked undergraduate psychology students to complete choice RT tasks requiring the semantic categorisation of visually-presented words, and compared performance with redundant targets from the same semantic category to performance with redundant targets from different semantic categories. If the redundancy gains resulted from the combination of information at a semantic level, they should have been greater in the former than the latter situation. However, our results showed no significant differences in redundancy gain (for latency and accuracy) between same-category and different-category conditions, despite gains appearing in both conditions. Thus, we suggest that redundancy gain in the semantic categorisation task may result entirely from statistical facilitation or combination of information at non-semantic levels.

N2  - We consider the specific transformation of a Wiener process X(t), \, t \geq 0\ in the presence of an absorbing barrier a that results when this process is ``time-locked with respect to its first passage time bf T_a through a criterion level a, and the evolution of X(t) is considered backwards (retrospectively) from bf T_a. Formally, we study the random variables defined by Y(t) ≡ X(bf T_a-t) and derive explicit results for their density and mean, and their asymptotic forms. We discuss how our results can aid interpretations of time series ``response-locked to their times of crossing a criterion level.

N2  - Delta plots (DPs) graphically compare reaction time (RT) quantiles obtained under two experimental conditions. In some research areas (e.g., Simon effects), decreasing Delta plots (nDPs) have consistently been found, indicating that the experimental effect is largest at low quantiles and decreases for higher quantiles. nDPs are unusual and intriguing: they imply that RT in the faster condition is more variable, a pattern predicted by few standard RT models. We describe and analyze five classes of well-established latency mechanisms which are consistent with nDPs: exhaustive processing models, correlated stage models, mixture models, cascade models, and parallel channels models, and discuss the implications of our analyses for the interpretation of DPs. DPs generally do not imply any specific processing model; therefore, it is more fruitful to start from a specific quantitative model and to compare the DP it predicts with empirical data.

N2  - Many perceptual and cognitive tasks permit or require the integrated cooperation of specialized sensory channels, detectors, or other functionally separate units. In compound detection or discrimination tasks, one prominent general mechanism to model the combination of the output of different processing channels is probability summation. The classical example is the binocular summation model of Pirenne (1943), according to which a weak visual stimulus is detected if at least one of the two eyes detects this stimulus; as we review briefly, exactly the same reasoning is applied in numerous other fields. It is generally accepted that this mechanism necessarily predicts performance based on two (or more) channels to be superior to single channel performance because two separate channels provide "two chances" to succeed with the task. We argue that this reasoning is misleading because it neglects the increased opportunity with two channels not just for hits but also for false alarms, and that there may well be no redundancy gain at all when performance is measured in terms of ROC curves. We illustrate and support these arguments with a visual detection experiment involving different spatial uncertainty conditions. Our arguments and findings have important implications for all models which, in one way or another, rest on, or incorporate, the notion of probability summation for the analysis of detection tasks, 2AFC tasks, and psychometric functions.

N2  - We present a new quantitative process model (GSDT) of visual search that seeks to integrate various processing mechanisms suggested by previous studies within a single, coherent conceptual frame. It incorporates and combines four distinct model components: guidance (G), a serial (S) item inspection process, diffusion (D) modeling of individual item inspections, and a strategic termination (T) rule. For this model, we derive explicit closed-form results for response probability and mean search time (RT) as a function of display size and target presence/absence. The fit of the model is compared in detail to data from four visual search experiments in which the effects of target/distractor discriminability and of target prevalence on performance (present/absent display size functions for mean RT and error rate) are studied. We describe how GSDT accounts for various detailed features of our results such as the probabilities of hits and correct rejections and their mean RTs; we also apply the model to explain further aspects of the data, such as RT variance and mean miss RT.

N2  - Auditory redundancy gains were assessed in two experiments using a simple reaction time task. In each trial an auditory stimulus was presented either to the left ear, to the right ear, or simultaneously to both ears. The physical difference between auditory stimuli presented to the two ears was systematically increased across experiments. No redundancy gains were observed when the stimuli were identical pure tones or pure tones of different frequencies (Exp. 1). A clear redundancy gain and evidence of coactivation was obtained, however, when one stimulus was a pure tone and the other was white noise (Exp. 2). Experiment 3 employed a 2-AFC localization task and provided evidence that dichotically presented pure tones of different frequencies are apparently integrated to a single percept whereas a pure tone and white noise are not fused. The results extend previous findings of redundancy gains and coactivation with visual and bimodal stimuli to the auditory modality. Furthermore, at least within this modality, the results indicate that redundancy gains do not emerge when redundant stimuli are integrated into a single percept.

N2  - In two experiments, we examined simple reaction times (RTs) for detection of the onsets and the offsets of auditory stimuli. Both experiments assessed the redundant signals effect (RSE), which is traditionally defined as the reduction in RT associated with the presentation of two redundant stimuli rather than a single stimulus. In Experiment 1 with two identical tones presented via headphones to the left ear, right ear, or both, no RSE was found in responding to tone onsets, but a large RSE was found in responding to their offsets. In Experiment 2 with a pure tone and white noise as the two stimulus alternatives, RSEs were found for responding to both onsets and offsets. The results support the notion that the occurrence of an RSE depends on the number of percepts rather than the number of stimuli and on the requirement to respond to stimulus onsets versus offsets. The parallel grains model (Miller & Ulrich, 2003) provides one possible account of this pattern of results.

N2  - In a simple reaction time (RT) experiment, visual stimuli were stereoscopically presented either to one eye (single stimulation) or to both eyes (redundant stimulation), with brightness matched for single and redundant stimulations. Redundant stimulation resulted in two separate percepts when non-corresponding retinal areas were stimulated, whereas it resulted in a single fused percept when corresponding areas were stimulated. With stimulation of non-corresponding areas, mean RT was shorter to redundant than to single stimulation, replicating the redundant signals effect (RSE) commonly found with visual stimuli. With stimulation of corresponding areas, however, no RSE was observed. This suggests that the RSE is driven by the number of percepts rather than by the number of stimulated receptors or sensory organs. These results are consistent with previous findings in the auditory modality and have implications for models of the RSE.

N2  - Temporal preparation usually results in enhanced performance in choice reaction time tasks. The present study investigated to what extent temporal preparation involves increased readiness for task-specific processing requirements as opposed to increased task-independent readiness. Participants performed either a pitch, a letter, or a color discrimination task within a variable foreperiod paradigm and tasks alternated regularly between auditory and visual discriminations. In separate blocks of trials, the upcoming visual discrimination task was either predictable or unpredictable. We observed the standard variable foreperiod effect for both visual discrimination tasks irrespective of task predictability. Importantly, however, the variable foreperiod effect was larger when the visual discrimination task was predictable than when it was unpredictable. These results suggest that temporal preparation in choice reaction time tasks involves increased readiness for both task-independent and task-specific processing requirements.

N2  - Four reaction time experiments examined the mental rotation process using a psychological refractory period paradigm. On each trial, participants made speeded responses to both a tone (S-sub-1) and a rotated letter (S-sub-2), presented with varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). If mental rotation of the stimulus letter can proceed while central mechanisms are busy with S-sub-1, then the effect of orientation should decrease substantially with decreasing SOA. Contrary to these predictions, the effect of orientation was nearly constant across SOAs, suggesting that mental rotation cannot effectively proceed without help from central mechanisms. These results support the conclusion that mental rotation requires access to a single-channel mechanism and must therefore be performed serially with other operations requiring the same mechanism.

N2  - Conducted 2 experiments with 114 college students to determine if negative priming effects occur even when it is easy to discriminate target from distractor stimuli. In Exp 1, the usual negative priming effect was found when target and distractor positions varied from trial to trial, but not when these positions remained fixed. Exp 2 extended these results to a situation where the ease of selection varied only in the prime display. These findings argue that irrelevant inputs can be filtered out prior to stimulus identification under certain circumstances and therefore pose problems for strict late selection theories.

N2  - Conducted 6 experiments (n = 229) to determine if mental rotation (MR) can begin before perception finishes, as allowed by continuous flow models but not discrete stage models of information processing. Exps 1-3 found that the effect of shape discriminability on reaction time (RT) was underadditive with the effect of stimulus orientation, suggesting that MR began before shape discrimination had finished and that the 2 processes overlapped in time. The results of Exps 4-6 indicate that MR can overlap with color discriminations as well. In both sets of experiments, however, the amount of underadditivity tended to be much less than predicted by models allowing interference-free overlap. This suggests that MR can overlap with perceptual analysis, contrary to fully discrete models, but that little rotation is carried out during this overlap due to interference between simultaneous discrimination and rotation processes.

N2  - In previous research, the parameters of the ex-Gaussian distribution have been subject to a wide variety of interpretations. The present study investigated whether the ex-Gaussian model is capable of distinguishing effects on separate processing stages (i.e., pre-motor vs. motor). In order to do so, we used datasets where the locus of effect was quite clear. Specifically, we analyzed data from experiments comparing hand vs. foot responses--presumably differing in the motor stage--and from experiments in which the lateralized readiness potential was used to localize experimental effects into premotor vs. motor processes. Moreover, we broadened the scope to two other descriptive RT models: the ex-Wald and EZ diffusion models. To the extent possible with each of these models, we reanalyzed the RT data of 19 clearly localized experimental effects from 12 separate experiments reported in seven previously published articles. Unfortunately, we did not find a clear pattern of results for any of the models, with no clear link between effects on one of the modelś parameters and effects on different processing stages. The present results suggest that one should resist the temptation to associate specific processing stages with individual parameters of the ex-Gaussian, ex-Wald, and EZ diffusion models.

N2  - In two experiments (N=60 each), we investigated the locus of backward crosstalk effects in dual-tasking.  Specifically, we embedded the typical flanker task within a dual-task paradigm by assigning stimulus-response (S-R) rules to the flankers.  In Experiment 1, participants were instructed to first respond to the center letter and only respond to the flanker if the center was a no-go stimulus (i.e., prioritized processing paradigm).  Mapping condition was varied between-subjects to be either matched (i.e., same S-R rule for flankers as for center letters), reversed (i.e., opposite S-R rule for flankers), or neutral (i.e., different letters for flankers with separate S-R rules).  The results indicated that the backward crosstalk effect was mainly driven by a stimulus-based compatibility, as indicated by a significant S2-R1 compatibility effect in the matched and reversed conditions, with little change in this effect between the matched and reversed conditions.  Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings to a psychological refractory period paradigm. The present findings suggest that in the matched and reversed conditions, there was only one S-R rule active at a time.

Some target-absent displays included only nontarget stimuli or features that never occurred in the same displays as targets, whereas other target-absent displays included nontarget stimuli or features that did sometimes occur with targets. Nontarget responses were reliably faster in the former case than in the latter. This ``associated nontargets effect indicates that nontargets are not simply classified as nontargets but in addition are discriminated from one another. Current visual search models may underestimate the degree to which nontargets are processed during search.

N2  - In a reanalysis of data from Cousineau and Shiffrin (2004) and two new visual search experiments, we used a likelihood ratio test to examine the full distributions of reaction time (RT) for evidence that the display size effect is a mixture-type effect that occurs on only a proportion of trials, leaving RT in the remaining trials unaffected, as is predicted by serial self-terminating search models. Experiment 1 was a reanalysis of Cousineau and Shiffrinś data, for which a mixture effect had previously been established by a bimodal distribution of RTs, and the results confirmed that the likelihood ratio test could also detect this mixture. Experiment 2 applied the likelihood ratio test within a more standard visual search task with a relatively easy target/distractor discrimination, and Experiment 3 applied it within a two-alternative forced-choice search task within the same types of stimuli. Neither of these experiments provided any evidence for the mixture-type display size effect predicted by serial self-terminating search models. Overall, these results suggest that serial self-terminating search models may generally be applicable only with relatively difficult target/distractor discriminations, and then only for some participants. In addition, they further illustrate the utility of analyzing full RT distributions in addition to mean RT.

N2  - Three experiments investigated the effect of stimulus probability on same-different classification time. In Exps I and II, Ss made same responses on the basis of name matches of simultaneously presented letters. Half of the same trials involved letters that were also physically identical. Exp I shows that the presentation probability of specific letters affected name matches and different responses, but not physical matches. Exp II varied stimulus contrast as well as probability. Contrast had a main effect but did not interact with probability at any level of processing. In Exp III, Ss were switched to the physical level of processing. Stimuli that had the same name but differed in case were called different. In this condition, the probability effects observed in Exp II disappeared. These results are interpreted as demonstrating that stimulus probability has its effects during the process that derives the name of the stimulus from the visual representation. This process takes place before the name comparison is made, and the name comparison process precedes the determination of the different response.

N2  - This study investigated the redundant target effect (RTE) in partial split-brain (anterior section sparing the splenium), total split-brain, and neurologically intact individuals. All completed an RTE protocol in which targets were presented on the midline or in an inter- or intrahemispheric manner. Stimuli of different nature (luminance, equiluminant colour, and global motion) were used separately in three experiments in order to investigate the contribution of subcortical versus cortical pathways. Despite the preservation of the splenium (the portion of the corpus callosum assumed to transfer visual information), partial split-brain individuals showed an enhanced RTE pattern as compared to neurologically intact individuals. Total split-brain individuals showed a tendency toward larger RTEs with the luminance stimuli than with the colour and motion stimuli, whereas this was not the case for partial split-brain individuals, suggesting a contribution of the posterior portion of the corpus callosum in the RTE. It is therefore likely that both sensory and motor processes contribute to the enhanced RTE in split-brain individuals.

N2  - This study investigated interhemispheric transfer in ten normal, four anterior-, and four totally- split-brain individuals, through measures of manual asynchrony and bimanually-recorded crossed-uncrossed difference (CUD). The CUD relied on the difference between crossed and uncrossed responses whereas the asynchrony measure relied on the reaction time difference between the two responding hands. Manipulations of sensory and attentional factors were assessed for both measures. We found a normal CUD (3.8 ms) along with an exacerbated and more variable asynchrony for partial split-brain individuals (40.8 ms) compared to normal individuals (CUD: 0.4 ms, asynchrony: 13.8 ms). In turn, the CUD of total split-brain individuals (20.4 ms) was larger than that of partial split-brain and normal individuals. Also, the asynchrony of total split-brain individuals (57.6 ms) was larger and more variable than that of normal individuals, and more variable than that of partial split-brain individuals. We interpret these results as behavioural evidence of independent mechanisms underlying the CUD and bimanual synchronization, as well as evidence of the joint involvement of both the anterior and posterior portions of the corpus callosum in bimanual coordination.

N2  - The traditional explanation for dual-task interference is that tasks compete for scarce processing resources. Another possible explanation is that the outcome of the processing required for one task conflicts with the processing required for the other task (e.g., cross talk). To explore the contribution of outcome conflict to task interference, we manipulated the relatedness of the tasks. In Experiment 1, subjects searched concurrently for names of boys in one channel and names of cities in another channel. Responses were significantly delayed when nontarget on one channel belonged to, or was even just related to, the category designated as the target for the other channel. No comparable effects were found when the tasks were performed in isolation. Thus, the difficulty of the individual tasks is not the only determinant of how much they will interfere when combined, and there must be substantial interactions between processes carrying out the two tasks. In Experiment 2 subjects searched one channel for specific target letters and another channel for specific target digits. The nontargets in a channel were either from the same alphanumeric category as the targets for that channel or from the opposite category (i.e., the category of the targets for the other channel). It was found that although between-category search was more efficient than within-category search in single tasks, it was less efficient in dual tasks.

N2  - The model of a single central bottleneck for human information processing is critically examined. Most evidence cited in support of the model has been observed within the overlapping tasks paradigm. It is shown here that most findings obtained within that paradigm and that were used to support the model are also consistent with a simple resource model. The most prominent findings are the millisecond-for-millisecond slope at the left of the RT2-SOA curve, the high RT1-RT2 correlation, the additivity of the effects on RT2 of SOA and of the difficulty of selecting R2, and the washout of the effect of S2 discriminability on RT2 in a dual-task condition. In addition, the asymmetry of the effects of the dual-task requirement on RT1 and RT2 can be accounted for by the resource model provided that it assumes uneven allocation of resources, which is quite reasonable in view of the task asymmetry inherent in the demand characteristics of the paradigm. The same is true for two other findings that appear to support the single-bottleneck model, that in the dual-task condition, the demand of the first task affects equally RT1 and RT2, and that its effect on RT1 is the same as the corresponding effect in the single-task condition. Furthermore, the single-bottleneck model is hard to reconcile with a negative slope at the left of the RT1-SOA curve or a positive slope at the left of the IRI-SOA curve, unless augmented by ancillary assumptions that are yet to be substantiated. Representative data were fit by each of the models using its optimal set of parameters. Both models achieved quite good degrees of fit. It is further argued that since the overlapping tasks paradigm is heavily biased in favor of a speedy reaction to the stimulus that appears first, it is non-optimal for testing the central bottleneck model. Finally, the bottleneck model is examined in terms of other scientific criteria.

Other research has found more forceful responses to redundant-target than to single target displays, suggesting coactivation in the motor component. The authors tested for motor coactivation using response time, response force, and other psychophysiological measures. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that response force is determined by the number of stimuli, not the number of targets, when target-distract or discriminations are required. In Experiment 3, 1 stimulus was presented on each trial, and the number of target features was varied. The response time results showed that coactivation occurred somewhere in the information processing system, but no evidence of motor coactivation was found using any psychophysiological measure. These data disconfirm the motor-coactivation hypothesis for tasks that require visual discriminations.

N2  - Examined whether J. T. Mordkoff and S. Yantisś interactive race model of divided attention would apply to tasks with more than 1 type of target. Exp 1 found that the race-model inequality was not violated when the experimental design was free of biased contingencies; Exp 1 also found that target preferences may artifactually produce the reaction time (RT) advantage for different- over same-target trials. Exp 2, however, found that the race-model inequality was violated when the frequencies of single- and redundant-target displays were equated (without introducing any biased contingencies), implying that the interactive race model cannot account for the results of experiments involving more than 1 type of target.

N2  - In the present study, we introduce a novel self-organized task switching paradigm that can be used to study the determinants of switching more directly. Instead of instructing participants to randomly switch between tasks as in the classic voluntary task switching paradigm (Arrington & Logan, 2004), we instructed participants to optimize their task performance in a voluntary task switching environment in which the stimulus associated with the previously selected task appeared delayed in each trial. Importantly, the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) increased further with each additional repetition of this task, whereas the stimulus needed for a task switch was always immediately available. We conducted two experiments with different SOA increments (i.e., Exp. 1a. = 50 ms, Exp. 1b = 33 ms) to see whether this procedure would induce switching behavior, and we explored how people trade off switch costs against the increasing availability of the stimulus needed for a task repetition. We observed that participants adapted their behavior to the different task environments (i.e., SOA increments) and that participants switched tasks when the SOA in task switches approximately matched switch costs. Moreover, correlational analyses indicated relations between individual switch costs and individual switch rates across participants. Together, these results demonstrate that participants were sensitive to the increased availability of switch stimuli in deciding whether to switch or repeat, which in turn demonstrates flexible adaptive task selection behavior. We suggest that performance limitations in task switching interact with the task environment to influence switching behavior.

N2  - We conducted two multitasking experiments to examine the finding that first-task RTs are slower in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm than in the prioritized processing (PP) paradigm. To see whether this difference between the two paradigms could be explained entirely by differences in first-task preparation, which would be consistent with the standard response selection bottleneck (RSB) model for multitasking interference, we compared the size of this difference for trials in which a second-task stimulus actually occurred against the size of the difference for trials without any second-task stimulus. The slowing of first-task RTs in the PRP paradigm relative to the PP paradigm was larger when the second-task stimulus appeared than when it did not, indicating that the difference cannot be explained entirely by between-paradigm differences in first-task preparation. Instead, the results suggest that the slowing of first-task RTs in the PRP paradigm relative to the PP paradigm is partly due to differences between paradigms in the on-line reallocation of processing capacity to tasks. Thus, the present results provide new evidence supporting resource models over the RSB model.

N2  - In the present study, we tested the idea that relevant and irrelevant location-based activations are combined when selecting a response in the Simon task. For this purpose, we manipulated the strength of the relevant activation by using single versus redundant relevant stimuli to indicate the correct response. Assuming that relevant and irrelevant activations are summed during the decision process, the Simon effect should be reduced in the presence of the stronger relevant activation produced by redundant stimuli. Contrary to this expectation, the results revealed that the Simon effect was larger overall with redundant stimuli than with single stimuli. Importantly, distributional analyses indicated that the Simon effect was not reduced for redundant stimuli even when controlling for the opportunity for irrelevant location activation to dissipate after stimulus onset. These results are thus inconsistent with accounts in which the summation of decision-level activations is the cause of the Simon effect. Instead, these results are consistent with the idea that redundancy and irrelevant location information influence activations at different levels. Considering the findings of previous studies, the most likely account is that redundancy affects decision-level activations whereas relevant and irrelevant activation are integrated at the motor level to produce the Simon effect (i.e., decision locus of redundancy gain and motor locus of Simon effect).

N2  - Findings from studies using the voluntary task switching (VTS) paradigm (Arrington & Logan, 2004) suggest that task selection in multitasking can be influenced by both cognitive and environmental constraints. In the present study, we used an adaptive VTS paradigm to directly test whether and how people adapt to these two constraints when they are instructed to optimize their task performance. In five experiments, the availabilities of stimuli for two tasks in a trial changed predictably because the stimulus needed for a task repetition appeared with an SOA that increased linearly with the number of repetitions. Experiments 1a and 1b demonstrated that stimulus availability did not automatically induce switching behavior. Experiment 2 showed that the predictable external constraints were accommodated in participants ́switching behavior once participants overcame their reluctance to switch tasks. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that both switch costs and switch rates were influenced by manipulating the time between trials. Moreover, switch costs and switch rates were correlated across all experiments; and when the time for advanced preparation of task selection was limited (Experiment 1a, 1b, and certain conditions of Experiments 3 and 4), the SOA in task switches approximately matched switch costs. Together, these results point to a link between task selection and performance indicating that participants adapt their task selection behavior to mutual effects of external and internal influences on task performance. We propose that both task selection and task performance can be integrated within a framework of competing multiple task-set activations.

N2  - We combined analyses of reaction time (RT) distributions with experimental manipulations of different processing stages (perception, decision, motor execution) in a Simon task to investigate which changes in Simon effects could be explained entirely by fading irrelevant response activation. Consistent with fading activation accounts, the Simon effect on mean RT was usually smaller for conditions with slower responses (Expts. 1-3 but not Expt. 4), and delta plot analyses revealed that it was always smaller for the slower responses within each condition. Critically, however, these analyses also revealed that some experimental manipulations produced upward or downward shifts in the RT delta plots, thus altering the Simon effect on mean RT in ways that could not be explained by fading activation. The results demonstrate the power of combining RT distributional analyses with experimental manipulations to reveal mechanisms contributing to the Simon effect that would not be revealed using only mean RT. We consider alternatives to fading activation accounts of decreasing delta plots and discuss the contribution of different cognitive stages in modulating Simon effects.

N2  - Four experiments examined how accurately participants can report the times of their own decisions. Within an auditory reaction time (RT) task, participants reported the time at which (a) the tone was presented, (b) they decided on the response, or (c) the response key was pressed. Decision time reports were checked for plausibility against the actual RTs, and we compared the effects of experimental manipulations on these two measures to see whether the reported decision times showed appropriate effects. In addition, we estimated the amount of error associated with individual decision time reports by checking how often participants ́decision time reports were implausibly early (i.e., before stimulus onset) or late (i.e., after response), and by using several quantitative models. Overall, the results suggest that decision time reports are not very accurate but they may be usable for some purposes.

N2  - Two experiments tested predictions of the hemispheric coactivation model for redundancy gain (Miller, 2004). Simple reaction time (RT) was measured in divided attention tasks with visual stimuli presented to the left or right of fixation or redundantly to both sides. Experiment 1 tested the prediction that redundancy gain -- the decrease in RT when two stimuli are presented rather than one -- should increase when the response requires a greater degree of bilateral control by both hemispheres. In different blocks, the response was made with the left hand, the right hand, or both hands simultaneously. In accordance with the model, redundancy gain was larger with bimanual than with unimanual responses. Experiment 2 tested and found support for the prediction that redundancy gain should decrease when both hemispheres are activated by an irrelevant auditory accessory stimulus. Thus, the results support the hemispheric coactivation model.

N2  - Investigated the generality of the additive effects of reaction time (RT) within variants of the cascade model (J. L. McClelland, 1979). Predictions of models constructed with a number of different activation growth equations were examined. Time was varied in discrete 1-msec steps to perform computations, and for each model, predictions concerning additivity were assessed within the context of factors effecting the rate of processing. Models were constructed from 44 activation equations, predictions of stochastic models were obtained, and additivity was measured. Results show that additivity of factor effects on mean RT was compatible not only with discrete-stage and cascade models but also with a variety of overlapping-stage models having different growth equations. Models with low thresholds or large quanta were also consistent with variance additivity, as were models in which the rate of activation growth decreased with activation level.

N2  - We compared individual-participant and jackknife-based methods for scoring the onset latencies of event-related potential (ERP) components using a diffusion process as a model for an ERP. We studied ``ramp-like components in which the true ERP increases or decreases monotonically, except for noise. If the growth rates of such components vary across participants, the jackknife-based measure can easily have only 10--20% as much error variance as the traditional method, and this advantage is magnified with more participants. We also studied inverted-U-shaped or ``bump-like components. Jackknifing generally yielded smaller error variances with these components too, especially when the componentś peak amplitude varied across participants, but less so if the componentś peak latency varied. These results help illuminate the reasons for the superiority of jackknife-based onset latency measures over traditional measures in recent simulations.

N2  - Within the context of the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, we developed a general theoretical framework for deciding when it is more efficient to process two tasks in serial and when it is more efficient to process them in parallel. This analysis suggests that a serial mode is more efficient than a parallel mode under a wide variety of conditions and thereby suggests that ubiquitous evidence of serial processing in PRP tasks could result from performance optimization rather than from a structural bottleneck. The analysis further suggests that the experimenter-selected distribution of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) influences the relative efficiency of the serial and parallel modes, with a preponderance of short SOAs favoring a parallel mode. Experiments varying the distribution of SOAs were conducted, and the results suggest that there is a shift from a more serial mode to a more parallel mode as the likelihood of short SOAs increases.

N2  - Information processing models differ about whether stimulus intensity affects the speed of motor processes involved in response activation and execution. Previous studies of intensity are reviewed, but they are not decisive on this point because they have used indirect approaches requiring strong assumptions. Two experiments examined the effects of stimulus intensity on the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), a measure of hand-specific response activation. In Experiment 1, visual stimulus intensity influenced the time from stimulus onset to LRP onset but not the time from LRP onset to the keypress response. In Experiment 2, auditory stimulus intensity did not influence either of these time intervals, although it did influence the time from stimulus onset to the N100 and P300 components of the evoked potential. The results indicate that stimulus intensity does not influence the duration of motor processes in choice RT tasks.

N2  - We reanalyzed the data from the study of Y. Lamarre, L. Busby, and G. Spidalieri (1983). In that study, the activity of single neurons in area 4 of the motor cortex was recorded during a bimodal detection task in which a monkey (em Macaca mulatta) had to respond as quickly as possible to a visual or auditory signal or both (redundant trials). Manual responses on redundant trials were speeded by the presence of both signals, as is typically found. The times between signal onsets and the first changes in neuronal activity were also speeded by redundant signals, but there was no difference between redundant- and single-signals trials in the time between the change in neuronal activity and movement onset. These results suggest that late motor processes are not speeded by redundant signals in bimodal detection tasks.

N2  - Four experiments examined the effects of the number of alternative responses on the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Two- versus 6-choice tasks differed in both the time from stimulus onset to LRP onset and the time from LRP onset to the keypress response, suggesting that this factor influences the durations of processes both before and after the onset of hand-specific response activation. The effects of response probability were too small to be fully responsible for the effects of the number of alternatives. The compatibility of stimulus-to-finger assignments within a hand influenced primarily the durations of processes after LRP onset, suggesting that hand-specific response activation begins before the response finger has been selected. The results illustrate the utility of the LRP for the localization of factor effects within information-processing tasks.

N2  - Computer simulations examined the performance of the Spearman-Karber method for analyzing psychometric functions and compared this method with the standard technique of probit analysis. The Spearman-Karber method was found to be superior in most cases. It generally yielded less biased and less variable estimates of the location and dispersion of a psychometric function, and it provided more power to detect differences in these parameters across experimental conditions. Moreover, the Spearman-Karber method provided information about the skewness and higher moments of psychometric functions that is beyond the scope of probit analysis. These advantages of the Spearman-Karber method suggest that it should often be used in preference to probit analysis for the analysis of observed psychometric functions.

N2  - A race-like model is developed to account for various phenomena arising in simple reaction time (RT) tasks. Within the model, each stimulus is represented by a number of grains of information or activation processed in parallel. The stimulus is detected when a criterion number of activated grains reaches a decision center. Using the concept of statistical facilitation, the model accounts for many classical effects on mean simple RT, including those of stimulus area, stimulus intensity, stimulus duration, criterion manipulations, redundant stimuli, and the dissociation between intensity effects on simple RTs and temporal order judgments. The model is also consistent with distributional properties of simple RTs.

N2  - In three experiments we measured response time (RT) and peak force (PF) to investigate the grouping of left- and right-hand key press responses in a dual-task paradigm involving two independent go/no-go tasks. Within each task, a go stimulus within one of two modalities (i.e., visual versus auditory) required a response by one hand. In Experiment 1 with simultaneous go stimuli in the two tasks, responses appeared to be grouped in approximately 75--80% of trials, compared with nearly 100% grouping in a single-task condition requiring bimanual responses to the onset of any stimulus in either modality. In Experiment 2 with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 0--400 msec between the two go stimuli, response grouping clearly declined as SOA increased, although some grouping was still evident even at the longest SOA. The same pattern was observed in Experiment 3 with the same range of SOAs but unpredictable stimulus order, suggesting that grouping is not strongly dependent on prior knowledge of the likely response order. These results emphasize the pervasiveness of response grouping in bimanual dual-task RT paradigms and provide useful clues as to its nature.

Using the model, formulas were derived for the reliabilities of mean RTs and RT difference scores, and these formulas provide guidance about the number of trials per participant needed to obtain reliable estimates of these measures. In addition, formulas were derived for various different types of correlations computed in RT research (e.g., correlations between a mean RT and an external, non-RT measure, between two mean RTs, between a mean RT and an RT effect size). The analysis revealed that observed RT-based correlations depend on many parameters of the underlying processes contributing to RT. We conclude that these correlations often fail to support the inferences drawn from them and that their proper interpretation is far more complex than is generally acknowledged.

N2  - A model is presented for determining how total research payoff depends on researchers ́choices of sample sizes, p levels, and other parameters of the research process. The model can be used to quantify various trade-offs inherent in the research process and thus to balance competing goals, such as (a) maximizing both the number of studies carried out and also the statistical power of each study, (b) minimizing the rates of both false positive and false negative findings, and (c) maximizing both replicability and research efficiency. Given certain necessary information about a research area, the model can be used to determine the optimal values of sample size, statistical power, rate of false positives, rate of false negatives, and replicability, such that overall research payoff is maximized. More specifically, the model shows how the optimal values of these quantities depend upon the size and frequency of true effects within the area, as well as the individual payoffs associated with particular study outcomes. The model is particularly relevant within current discussions of how to optimize the productivity of scientific research, because it shows which aspects of a research area must be considered and how these aspects combine to determine total research payoff.

N2  - Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing must choose a critical ``alpha level, α, to use as a cutoff for deciding whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most fields, .05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as .01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal α level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although .05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal α could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one α level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular α level.

Each experiment compared performance in blocks of trials with constant and hence temporally predictable RS lags against performance in blocks with variable, unpredictable RS lags. In both experiments, essentially equivalent SAT functions were observed with constant and variable RS lags. We conclude that there is little effect of advance preparation for a given processing time, suggesting that the discrimination mechanisms underlying SAT functions are driven solely by bottom-up information processing in perceptual discrimination tasks.

N2  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded while participants waited to make spontaneous key press movements (Experiment 1) or waited for tones in a pitch judgment task (Experiment 2). In one condition of each experiment, participants also had to report a spotś position on a clock at the crucial time point (i.e., when they decided to move or when the tone was presented), mimicking a procedure used to assess the time of conscious awareness. In a second condition, there was no clock or temporal judgment. Average EEG activity preceding key presses was substantially different when participants had to monitor the clock than when they did not. Smaller clock-related differences in average EEG activity were also present preceding tone onsets. The effects of clock monitoring on EEG activity could be responsible for previous reports that movement-related brain activity begins before participants have consciously decided to move (e.g., Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983).

N2  - A diffusion model for simple reaction time (RT) and temporal order judgment (TOJ) tasks was developed to account for a commonly observed dissociation between these two tasks: most stimulus manipulations (e.g., intensity) have larger effects in RT tasks than in TOJ tasks. The model assumes that a detection criterion determines the level of sensory evidence needed to conclude that a stimulus has been presented. Analysis of the performance that would be achieved with different possible criterion settings reveals that performance is optimal using a lower criterion setting for the TOJ task than for the RT task. In addition, the model predicts that effects of stimulus manipulations should increase with the size of the detection criterion. Thus, the model suggests that commonly observed dissociations between RT and TOJ tasks may simply be due to performance optimization in the face of conflicting task demands.

N2  - We study a model of the research process in which the true effect size, the replication jitter due to changes in experimental procedure, and the statistical error of effect-size measurement are all normally distributed random variables. Within this model, we analyze the probability of successfully replicating an initial experimental result by obtaining either a statistically significant result in the same direction or by obtaining any effect in that direction. We analyze both the probability of successfully replicating a particular experimental effect (i.e., the _individual_ replication probability) and also the average probability of successful replication across different studies within some research context (i.e., the _aggregate_ replication probability), and we identify the conditions under which the latter can be approximated using the formulas of Killeen (2005a, 2007). We show how both of these probabilities depend on parameters of the research context that would rarely be known in practice. In addition, we show that the statistical uncertainty associated with the size of an initial observed effect would often prevent accurate estimation of the desired individual replication probability even if these research context parameters were known exactly. We conclude that accurate estimates of replication probability are generally unattainable.

N2  - Neuroscientific studies have shown that brain activity correlated with a decision to move can be observed before a person reports being consciously aware of having made that decision (e.g., Libet, Gleason, Wright, & Pearl, 1983; Soon, Brass, Heinze, & Haynes, 2008). Given that a later event (i.e., conscious awareness) cannot cause an earlier one (i.e., decision-related brain activity), such results have been interpreted as evidence that decisions are made unconsciously (e.g., Libet, 1985). We argue that this interpretation depends upon an all-or-none view of consciousness, and we offer an alternative interpretation of the early decision-related brain activity based on models in which conscious awareness of the decision to move develops gradually up to the level of a reporting criterion. Under this interpretation, the early brain activity reflects sub-criterion levels of awareness rather than complete absence of awareness and thus does not suggest that decisions are made unconsciously.

N2  - Most psychological models are intended to describe processes that operate within each individual. In many research areas, however, models are tested by looking at results averaged across many individuals, despite the fact that such averaged results may give a misleading picture of what is true for each one. We consider this conundrum with respect to the interpretation of on-average null effects. Specifically, even though an experimental manipulation might have no effect on average across individuals, it might still have demonstrable effects---albeit in opposite directions---for many or all of the individuals tested. We discuss several examples of research questions for which it would be theoretically crucial to determine whether manipulations really have no effect at the individual level, and we present a method of testing for individual-level effects.

N2  - Online response preparation was assessed in a visual search task using rapid serial visual presentation. In each trial a series of letters was presented sequentially, and participants were instructed to make a target-present response if a prespecified target letter was presented or a target-absent response if it was not. Measurements of response preparation using both probe reaction time (RT) and the lateralized readiness potential indicated that preparation of the target-absent response increased near the end of the sequence. It appeared that most of the increase was due to direct priming of the target-absent response by nontarget letters, but part was due to the increased conditional probability of this response near the end of the sequence. These results extend previous studies of response preparation by showing online response preparation during a temporally extended RT task.

N2  - Spatial congruence ("Simon") effects on reaction time (RT) and response force (RF) were studied in two experiments requiring speeded choice responses to the color of a stimulus located irrelevantly to the left or right of fixation. In Experiment 1 with unimanual responses, both RT and incorrect-hand RF were sensitive to spatial congruence, and both showed larger Simon effects following a congruent trial than following an incongruent one. RT and incorrect-hand RF were dissociated in distributional (i.e., delta plot) analyses, however. As in previous studies, the Simon effect on RT was largest for the fastest responses and diminished as RT increased (i.e., decreasing delta plot). In contrast, Simon effects on RF did not decrease for slower responses; if anything, they increased slightly. In Experiment 2 participants made bimanual responses, allowing measurement of the spatial congruence effect for each trial. Responses were both faster and more forceful with the spatially congruent hand than with the spatially incongruent one, but neither of these effects decreased for slower responses. Overall, the results demonstrate that at least some motor-level effects of irrelevant spatial location persist for slower responses.

N2  - Observations of single neurons in the primary motor cortex of 1 monkey provided evidence that preliminary perceptual information reaches the motor system before perceptual analysis is complete. Neurons were recorded during a task in which 1 stimulus was assigned to a wrist flexion response and another was assigned to wrist extension. Two stimuli were assigned to a no-go response; each was visually similar to either the flexion or the extension stimulus. When a no-go stimulus was presented, neurons responded with weaker versions of the discharge patterns exhibited to the visually similar stimulus requiring a movement, suggesting that neurons receive partial perceptual information favoring that movement. Functionally separate neuronal populations were identified, and differences in the activations of these provide evidence about the functional effects of preliminary perceptual output on movement control processes.

N2  - In target detection tasks, responses are faster when displays have two targets ("redundant targets effect," RTE) and slower when they have no targets ("nontargets effect," NTE), relative to displays with a single target. The psychological refractory period paradigm was used to localize these effects. In Experiment 1, participants classified tones as high or low, and then classified letters as targets or nontargets after a short or long stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). The magnitudes of the RTE and NTE did not depend on SOA. In Experiment 2, the order of the tasks was reversed, and at short SOAs the RTE and NTE had similar magnitudes for both tone discrimination and target detection responses. These findings suggest that the RTE and NTE arise during response selection. Interactive effects of tone pitch with the number and type of target features were also observed, and these were tentatively interpreted as synesthetic effects.

In Exp I Ss were run in a Sternberg paradigm with a fixed-set procedure, and stimulus quality was manipulated by varying the contrast between the stimulus and its background. Both stimulus probability and stimulus quality affected RT, and the interaction of these 2 variables was highly significant. In Exp II stimulus probability and quality were varied as in Exp I, but Sś task was to name the stimulus. Again, stimulus probability and quality affected RT, although both effects were smaller than in Exp I. The interaction of stimulus probability and quality was also significant. Results of both experiments indicate that stimulus probability affects the stimulus encoding stage; this was interpreted as evidence against recent self-terminating search models of the memory scanning process.

Exp I replicated a previous finding of an interaction between stimulus probability and stimulus quality in a memory scanning task with numbers as stimuli. Exps II and III investigated the same paradigm with unfamiliar visual forms as stimuli, and no interaction was found. Results are interpreted as showing that probability affects the encoding mechanism only when the encoding process results in a representation of the name of the stimulus. When stimulus materials are visual forms without names, probability does not appear to affect encoding processes.

N2  - Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were measured in left/right/no-go tasks using compound global/local stimuli. In Experiment 1, participants responded to local target shapes and ignored global ones. RTs were affected by the congruence of the global shape with the local one, and LRPs indicated that irrelevant global shapes activated the responses with which they were associated. In Experiment 2, participants responded to conjunctions of target shapes at both levels, withholding the response if a target appeared at only one level. Global shapes activated responses in no-go trials, but local shapes did not. The results are consistent with partial-output models in which preliminary information about global shape can partially activate responses that are inconsistent with the local shape. They also demonstrate that part of the global advantage arises early, before response activation begins and probably before recognition of the local shape.

N2  - Psychophysiological measures were used to compare the response preparation and response execution processes of modified versions of F. C. Dondersś (1868/1969) classic simple, go/no-go, and choice reaction time tasks. On all measures, differences between tasks were minimal prior to test stimulus onset, supporting the idea of equivalent motor preparation for the three tasks. In addition, the psychophysiological measures indicated that the time from the onset of motor processing to the keypress response was also approximately constant across tasks. These results support the assumption that the mean duration of motor processes can be invariant across simple, go/no-go, and choice tasks, at least for the present modified versions of these tasks. The findings emphasize the utility of psychophysiological measures for both examining preparatory processes preceding stimulus onset and for localizing effects on reaction time.

N2  - Contends that researchers testing certain race models of reaction time (RT) sometimes want to estimate the smaller of the true mean (or median) RTs in 2 experimental conditions. The standard practice is to collect a number of observations in each condition and then take the smaller of the observed mean RTs as the estimate of the smaller of the 2 true means. This procedure underestimates the smaller of the 2 true means. The authors present computer simulations that investigate the size of this bias as a function of sample size, variance and shape of RT distributions, and separation between the true means of the 2 conditions. It is suggested that the amount of bias is directly related to the standard errors of the mean RTs and inversely related to the separation between the true means. Bias can exceed 50 msec under some conditions.

This is of interest in comparisons involving cumulative probability distributions of reaction time (RT) that are used to test race models of redundancy gain observed in certain divided-attention paradigms. In absolute terms, this bias can be quite large, exceeding 175 msec in some conditions. The bias increased with the percentage of fast guesses and with the latency difference between the lower tails of guess and nonguess RT distributions. Discarding and rerunning errors reduced bias somewhat, but a more elaborate kill-the-twin procedure reduced it much more.

N2  - Four experiments were conducted to compare the effects of redundant stimuli on temporal order judgments (TOJs) and reaction times (RTs). In Experiments 1 and 2 participants were presented in each trial with a tone and with one or two visual stimuli. They were asked to judge whether the tone or the visual display was presented first. Judgments of the relative onset times of the visual and auditory stimuli were virtually unaffected by the presentation of redundant rather than single visual stimuli. Experiments 3 and 4 used simple RT tasks with the same stimuli, and responses were much faster to redundant than to single visual stimuli. It appears that the traditional speed-up of RT associated with redundant visual stimuli arises after the stimulus detection processes to which TOJs are sensitive.

There was no effect: Responses to one case of a letter did not depend on the probability of occurrence of the other case. This finding indicates that facilitation of visual encoding by high probability of occurrence is not caused by increased activation at the level of the name code. Additional results lead to the conclusion that facilitation is caused by activation along specific routes by which visual features activate letter names.

N2  - A series of studies assessed perceptual-motor transmission of stimulus information by measuring lateralization of movement-related brain potentials in a choice reaction task with no-go trials. When stimuli varied in shape and size, lateralized potentials on no-go trials suggested that easily recognized shape information was used to initiate motor preparation and that this preparation was aborted when size analysis signified that the response should be withheld. This indicates that movement preparation can begin once partial perceptual information about a stimulus becomes available, contrary to an assumption of fully discrete models of information processing. By contrast, when stimuli varied only in size, no evidence for preliminary response preparation was obtained, contrary to an assumption of fully continuous models but consistent with asynchronous discrete coding models (J. Miller, 1982, 1988).

In particular, we assessed whether the motor potentials generated during combined movements were simply superpositions of the potentials generated during the individual movements in isolation. ERPs generated during single-limb movements replicated previously observed motor potentials, and those generated during both the execution (Experiment 1) and preparation (Experiment 2) of combined movements showed some deviations from the predictions of the superposition hypothesis, suggesting the presence of neural interactions between the hand and foot movement systems during preparation and execution of these actions.

These results are problematic for models that localize the effects of auditory intensity on purely perceptual processes, indicating instead that intensity also affects motor output processes under many circumstances. Experiment 1 compared simple RT, go-no-go, and choice RT tasks, using the same stimuli for all tasks. Auditory stimulus intensity affected both RT and RF, and these effects were not modulated by task. In Experiments 2-4, an irrelevant auditory accessory stimulus accompanied a relevant visual stimulus, and the go-no-go and choice tasks were used. Intensity of the irrelevant auditory accessory stimulus was found to affect RT and RF, although the sizes of these effects depended somewhat on the temporal predictability of the accessory stimulus.

N2  - We examined whether responses of the two hands are completely unitized when participants produce bimanual responses to lateralized targets in a Simon-type paradigm. A primary aim was to investigate whether lateralized stimuli differentially influence the response dynamics of the two hands. Simon effects were obtained in reaction time and force, with faster and more forceful components of the bimanual response with the hand on the same side as the lateralized stimulus as compared with the other hand. Also, Simon effects were larger when the lateralized target appeared alone than when it was accompanied by a distractor on the other side of the display. Finally, responses of the two hands were correlated most strongly when stimulus displays were symmetrical. We conclude that bimanual responses are strongly coupled but not perfectly so.

N2  - Two experiments investigated multitasking performance with a new "prioritized-processing paradigm" in which participants responded only to a high-priority primary task when this task required some action, responding to a low-priority background task only when no action was required for the primary task. In both experiments, performance was worse on the primary task than on the same task performed in isolation, indicating that this attempt to give absolute priority to the primary task is not sufficient to protect it from multitasking interference. Multitasking interference was present for task-repetition trials as well as task-alternation trials, so the interference could not be completely explained as a task-switching cost. In addition, responses to the primary task were influenced by their compatibility with the responses associated with the stimulus for the background task, indicating there was some activation of S-R associations within the background task even when this task did not require any response. The findings generalize a number of effects from the psychological refractory period and task-switching paradigms to the prioritized-processing paradigm, thereby providing hints as to the underlying mechanisms responsible for those effects. The "prioritized-processing paradigm" appears to have several desirable features for the study of multitasking interference.

N2  - Four experiments examined whether well-established phenomena from the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm are also observed in the prioritized processing paradigm, as would be expected from a common description of the two paradigms with the response selection bottleneck (RSB) model. Consistent with a generalization of the RSB model to the prioritized processing paradigm, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that this paradigm yields effects of SOA and stimulus discriminability analogous to those observed in the PRP paradigm. In Experiments 3 and 4, however, overall RTs and effect sizes differed between the PRP and prioritized processing paradigms in ways that are difficult to explain within the RSB model. Understanding the differences between these two paradigms offers considerable promise as a way to extend the RSB model beyond the domain of the PRP paradigm and to generalize our understanding of multi-tasking interference.

N2  - Compared 2 measures of response preparation: lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) and reaction times (RTs) to probe stimuli. 12 17-43 yr old college students volunteered to participate in the experiment. Ss responded with the left and right hands to target Sś and Tś of 1 size, withholding responses to nontarget Sś and Tś of a different size. The size discrimination was more difficult than the S vs T discrimination, so the name of a nontarget letter was expected to prime the response hand to which it was assigned. This priming had no effect on LRPs but did influence RTs to separate probe stimuli, suggesting that LRPs and probe-RTs are sensitive to different aspects of response preparation. Results show the dissociation between these 2 measures of response preparation.

N2  - The neural processes underlying an unplanned shift in movement control across limb systems were studied by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) as participants made a left or right hand movement followed by a left or right foot movement, or vice versa. ERPs associated with both first and second movements replicated a recent finding that Cz is more positive before hand than foot responses. Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) associated with the first movement replicated patterns observed previously with single movements, but LRPs leading up to the second movement depended strongly on the side of the first movement, possibly because of residual lateralization from it. Overall, the results suggest that the motor processes associated with limb system selection can be fully reset prior to a switch between hand and foot movements, but the processes associated with side selection may not be.

N2  - In eight experiments using language processing tasks ranging from lexical decision to sensibility judgment, participants made hand or foot responses after reading hand- or foot-associated words such as action verbs. In general, response time (RT) tended to be faster when the hand- versus foot-associated word was compatible with the limb that was required to respond (e.g., hand response to a hand-associated word) than when it was incompatible (e.g., foot response to a hand-associated word). To see whether this compatibility effect reflects differential hand- versus foot-specific motor activation produced by the words, as suggested by some embodied theories of language understanding, we monitored two event-related potential (ERP) measures previously found to be sensitive to the activation of these limbs. As expected, the ERP results replicated previous findings that the monitored ERPs differ for hand versus foot movements. More importantly, the ERPs provided no evidence of any difference for hand- versus foot-associated words. Thus, the results weaken previous claims that the understanding of action verbs requires activation of the motor areas used to carry out the named action. Instead, they support claims that language-related compatibility effects on RT may arise prior to motor processes, which implies that such effects are not decisive evidence for embodied language understanding.

N2  - Two experiments tested whether Ss switched or shared attention between 2 simultaneously relevant line-length discrimination tasks. Switching models that allowed within- as well as between-trial switching were considered. In Exp 1, stimulus duration was varied randomly from trial to trial. With varied durations, many switching models predict negative contingencies: for a given duration and attentional allocation, accurate responses on one task should be associated with inaccurate responses on the other task. The results, however, showed no negative contingencies, which is consistent with sharing models. In Exp 2, stimulus duration was reduced to 20 msec, yet responses were more than 75% correct overall. Results of both experiments support sharing models.

N2  - Two experiments investigated the effect of visuospatial attention on redundancy gain in simple reaction time tasks. In each trial participants were given a central arrow cue indicating where a stimulus would most likely be presented (i.e., upper or lower half of the display in Experiment 1; left or right half of the display in Experiment 2). Then, a single stimulus or two redundant stimuli could be presented in either expected or unexpected locations. Replicating previous findings, responses were faster when stimuli appeared in expected rather than unexpected locations, and they were also faster when two redundant stimuli were presented than when only one was. Critically, redundancy gain was statistically equivalent for stimuli in expected and unexpected locations, suggesting that the effect of redundancy gain arises after the perceptual processes influenced by the allocation of visuospatial attention.

N2  - Two experiments examined the effects of irrelevant information on the multidimensional "same-different" task. Ss were instructed to compare 2 geometric figures with respect to certain attributes but to ignore other attributes in making the "same-different" decision. The irrelevant attributes were chosen in such a way that they could not easily be ignored to see how the existence of irrelevant differences would affect the comparison process. As expected, the overall latencies were longer than usually found in tasks with no irrelevant differences. However, the nature of the comparison process appeared unchanged. The usual finding of a "fast-same" phenomenon persisted even when irrelevant information was present. The similarity of the results in this task to results in the "same-different" task with no irrelevant features supports the idea that the same comparison mechanism is used whether or not irrelevant differences are present in the stimulus pairs. Results suggest a more general-purpose comparison mechanism than is usually included in models of this task. Two-process models of visual comparisons are thus ruled out entirely. A modified version of L. Kruegerś (1970-1978) noisy-operator theory does appear consistent with the results.

Overall results indicate that (a) there are accumulation processes in the identification of letters by the perceptual system; (b) speed-accuracy criteria may also be perceptual in nature; (c) there is not just 1 evidence accumulation process in the perceptual system, but many; and (d) the perceptual system can make highly specific adjustments to task demands. Implications for general theories of an adaptive perceptual system are discussed, and in particular, similarities are noted between the mechanisms of perceptual adjustment identified in the present studies and those identified in studies of set, speed stress, and stimulus probability.

N2  - Four choice reaction time experiments documented a stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility effect involving the numbers of stimuli and responses. In Experiment 1 the stimulus consisted of one or two tones, and the correct response was either one or two taps of a response key. Responses were much faster with a compatible S-R assignment, in which the number of taps matched the number of tones, than with an incompatible assignment in which these numbers mismatched. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect using visual stimuli and bimodal stimuli, respectively, suggesting that auditory/manual rhythmic compatibility is not essential to it. Experiment 4 showed that an analogous but smaller effect is obtained when stimuli are the digits "1" and "2". This new numerosity-based compatibility effect has general theoretical implications regarding the mechanisms responsible for compatibility effects and practical implications for interface design.

N2  - Three experiments with 84 undergraduates investigated the effects of expectancy and stimulus frequency in character classification and identification tasks. Both expectancy and frequency had effects on overall response latency, but the 2 factors had different patterns of interaction with 2 other experimental variables. The effect of visual quality was larger for low-frequency than for high-frequency stimuli, whereas the effect of quality was independent of expectancy. The effect of stimulus-response (S) compatibility was more strongly influenced by whether a stimulus was expected than by the frequency of the stimulus. Results suggest that expectancy and frequency have somewhat different effects on human information-processing mechanisms. Expectancy allows temporary preparation for a specific S pair in response selection processes, but it has no effect on perceptual processes. Stimulus frequency, on the other hand, influences the efficiency of both perceptual and response selection processes. The overall effect of stimulus probability may be interpreted as having both expectancy and frequency effects as components.

N2  - Standard response-selection bottleneck models of performance in psychological refractory period (PRP) tasks suggest that a Task-1 response should be unaffected by the Task-2 response in the same trial, because selection of the former finishes before selection of the latter begins. Contrary to this conception, we found backward response-level crosstalk effects in which Task-2 response force requirements influenced the force-time dynamics of Task-1 responses. In two PRP experiments, Task 2 required a hard or soft key press response. Task-1 responses were harder when the upcoming Task-2 response was to press hard rather than soft, suggesting some activation of Task-2 response parameters before Task-1 processing reached the final ballistic stage of motor output. A third experiment using a single-task flankers paradigm showed that this effect did not arise from automatic activation of responses by the stimuli associated with hard and soft responses. This backward response-level crosstalk extends previous findings of backward crosstalk in the PRP paradigm by showing that crosstalk can affect motor output as well as response time and that such crosstalk can arise even when the two tasks being performed are not semantically related.

N2  - A simple reaction time (RT) experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that redundancy gain arises partly because of hemispheric coactivation. Stimuli were presented to the left or right of fixation, or redundantly to both, and participants had to make keypress responses as rapidly as possible to stimulus onset. A "static" condition, in which participants held the hands at rest, was compared with a "dynamic" condition, in which they moved the hands back and forth in an oscillating motion prior to stimulus onset. As predicted from the hypothesis of hemispheric coactivation, redundancy gain, measured as the decrease in mean RT to redundant stimuli as compared with single stimuli, was smaller in the dynamic condition than in the static one.

N2  - Notes that commonly discussed models of performance in the multidimensional same-different task are based on the assumption that independent same-different decisions are reached for each of the stimulus dimensions used in an experiment. In these models, a higher level mechanism examines the outcome of these independent decisions to determine whether the stimuli are the same or different overall. Previous evidence indicating that these models are inconsistent with results from same trials is summarized, and a new test of the above assumption using data from different trials is proposed. Detailed analysis of reaction times from different trials is shown, at least for some pairs of dimensions, to be incompatible with the view that separate same-different decisions are reached for each dimensions. The major finding from 2 experiments using 52 right-handed Ss, is that there were more relatively fast responses in a condition with 2 dimensions different, compared with the 2 conditions with only 1 of the dimensions different, than any processing model treating the dimensions separately could predict. The results suggest that partial information may be combined across dimensions to reach a "different" judgment.

N2  - Six experiments investigated the influence of frequency of occurrence of a visual stimulus (stimulus probability) on encoding processes, to investigate the mechanisms that allow cognitive processes to modify perceptual processes. Exps I and II show that frequently occurring visual letters did not facilitate encoding of visually similar letters, suggesting that stimulus probability does not directly affect the feature detectors used in encoding the letters. Exps III-VI provide evidence that stimulus probability had its effect on the availability of an abstract code that was generated by the encoding process from the visual input. Results from the experiments with letter stimuli are interpreted using a model similar to the logogen model of J. Morton (1969). Experiments with nonsense forms suggest that Ss used abstract codes in dealing with the forms only when the stimuli were constructed from a set of orthogonal features. A secondary finding was that visual quality had an effect that extended past the feature analysis stage and into a stage in which the visual input activated an abstract code. This result calls into question the common practice of interpreting the interaction of a factor with visual quality as evidence that the factor affects visual feature analysis.

Previous experiments show that information about global characteristics of an array is extracted by the visual system before information about local characteristics. Results from a task in which S must attend to both global and local information demonstrate that local information had a large influence on RT even when information at the global level was sufficient to determine the response. This finding implies that local information becomes available to decision processes with a time course similar to that of global information. Effects previously attributed to the order in which different levels of structure are recognized may result from differential ease of directing attention to these different levels and selecting responses based on them.

N2  - Many models of divided attention assume that signals presented on different channels produce separate activations, any one of which can initiate a response. According to these models, detection responses are especially fast when signals are presented on two channels at the same time because the system can detect a signal in either of two ways. Such models predict a testable relation among reaction time distributions for conditions in which a single signal is presented as compared with a condition in which 2 signals are presented, and this prediction is tested in two tasks. A bimodal detection task required a simple speeded response to either a visual or an auditory signal. A letter search task required a choice response depending on whether or not a two-letter display included the signal letter "A." Data from both tasks are inconsistent with the prediction. When two signals are presented, responses are faster than separate-activation models can explain. The results favor "coactivation" models, in which signals presented on different channels contribute to a common pool of activation that initiates a response.

N2  - Introduces a technique to study the flow of information through processing stages in choice RT tasks. The technique was designed to determine whether response preparation can begin before stimulus identification is complete ("continuous" models), or if a stimulus must be fully identified prior to any response activation ("discrete" models). To control the information available at various times during stimulus identification, some relevant stimulus characteristics were made easy or difficult to discriminate. Ss were 68 right-handed undergraduates. The usefulness of partial output was varied by manipulating the assignments of stimuli to responses. For some mappings, partial information could contribute to effective response preparation because the responses consistent with partial information were assigned to fingers on the same hand; for other mappings, partial information was assigned to fingers of different hands. Performance differences between these mappings were considered evidence that partial information about a stimulus was transmitted to response activation processes before the stimulus was identified and thus were considered evidence against discrete transmission of information about the stimulus as a whole. Results suggest that information is transmitted discretely with respect to stimulus codes, although distinct codes activated by a single stimulus may be transmitted at different times.

N2  - Four forced-choice letter-detection experiments with 164 undergraduates examined the effect on detection latency of noise letters (NLs) that were visually similar to target letters. A single target letter was present in each display. NLs were similar to the target letter present in the display (the signal), to a different target letter assigned to the same response as the signal, or to a target letter assigned to the opposite response from the signal. NLs were present in either relevant or irrelevant display positions, and 2 stimulus sets were used. The experiments were designed to test a prediction of models in which information about NLs is transmitted continuously from the recognition to the decision process. These models predict that responses should be faster when NLs are visually similar to a target assigned to the same response as the signal than when NLs are similar to a target assigned to the opposite response. Statistically reliable effects of the type predicted by continuous models were obtained when NLs appeared in relevant display positions, but not when they appeared in irrelevant positions.

N2  - Conducted 8 experiments that attempted to determine whether information obtained early in the process of recognizing a stimulus can be used to begin preparing keypress responses before recognition of the stimulus has finished. This question is relevant to the recent debate between discrete and continuous models of human information processing. Stimulus sets were chosen so that recognition processes could extract incomplete preliminary information about a stimulus faster than they could extract secondary information needed for stimulus identification. Discriminability of secondary information was manipulated to vary the opportunity for response preparation (RP) based on preliminary information, with difficult secondary discriminations providing more time for RP than easy ones. Precues were given on some trials to allow RP to occur before the stimulus was presented, thereby reducing any difference in RP as a function of discriminability. Continuous models predict that precues should facilitate RP less when the secondary discrimination is difficult than when it is easy, and discrete models predict equal facilitation regardless of secondary discrimination difficulty. Evidence of RP was obtained with some but not all stimulus sets. Results are interpreted as support for the asynchronous discrete coding model.

N2  - In a divided attention situation, preliminary response activations produced by stimuli on one channel were revealed through their effects on responses to stimuli on a secondary probe channel. Subjects performed concurrent but independent four-choice reaction-time tasks using the same four response fingers (middle and index fingers on both hands). In the main task, targets were large and small Ss and Ts, and medium-sized Ss and Ts sometimes appeared as distractors. Targets in the probe task were squares differing in location. A response to a probe square was faster if a distractor letter presented just before it had the same name as the target letter corresponding to that square (i.e., assigned to the same response key) than if the distractor letter had a different name--a result indicating that distractor letters cause partial response preparation. The timecourse of the effect demonstrated that preparation was based on preliminary information about distractor name that was available before distractor size had been determined. The results support models in which response preparation can sometimes begin before stimulus recognition has finished.

N2  - Conducted 6 experiments to examine the importance of flanker priming in the selective-attention paradigm of Eriksen and Eriksen (1974). Ss classified target letters presented in the relevant center position of a 3-letter visual display, ignoring simultaneously presented irrelevant flanker letters on each side of it. Although Ss had been instructed to ignore the flankers and later seemed to have no awareness of their correlation with correct responses, response times indicated that Ss learned and were influenced by the predictive relationship of the flanker to the response. These findings contradict the filter and attention-and-priming early selection models and provide examples of semantic processing of unattended stimuli that have not been primed by either task relevance or long-term relevance and of associative learning that is both incidental and apparently unconscious.

N2  - Considers the definitions of the terms discrete and continuous information-processing models and concludes that a dichotomous categorization of models is a serious oversimplification, since discreteness and continuity are 2 extremes between which there can be intermediate cases. Any complete model of an information-processing task assumes several different stages, of which some could be relatively discrete and others relatively continuous. Much evidence commonly cited in support of continuous models can be reconciled with fully discrete models. There is no compelling evidence against the discrete stage assumption of the additive factor method of S. Sternberg.

N2  - In visual search tasks, targets are detected more rapidly when they appear in locations that commonly contain a target than when they appear in locations that rarely contain a target. Five experiments were conducted to investigate 2 specific properties of this location probability effect. In Exp I spatial location of a stimulus row was varied to determine whether high location probability facilitates target detection in a particular location in visual space or a particular relative position within the row. Both were facilitated to approximately the same extent. In Exp II an inducing target occurred with high probability in 1 of 4 display locations, and a test target occurred with equal probability in all 4 locations. Both targets were found more quickly in the high-probability location than in the other locations, but the advantage associated with targets in the high-probability location was larger for the inducing target than for the test target. In Exps III-V the correspondence between the components observed in Exps I and II was examined. The overall pattern of results was compatible with a model in which the location probability effect is produced partly by an attentional spotlight, which facilitates processing of any stimulus appearing in a particular location in visual space, and partly by a network of position-specific letter detectors, which facilitates detection of a particular letter in a particular relative position within a display.

N2  - Previous studies have shown that responses can be partially activated by irrelevant stimuli in focused-attention tasks. In 2 experiments such response activation was used to investigate the organization of keypress responses. Stimuli were rows of 3 letters, with a relevant target letter in the middle of the row and irrelevant flanker letters on the outside. Four target letters were assigned to 4 keypress responses made with the index and middle fingers of the 2 hands. Irrelevant flankers were parentheses, a neutral letter, or 1 of the 4 target letters. Responses were fastest when flankers were identical to the target. When flankers were response-incompatible target letters, responses were faster if these were target letters assigned to a response finger on the same hand as the correct response. Findings are discussed in relation to discrete and continuous models of human information processing.

N2  - When used with positively skewed reaction time distributions, sample medians tend to overestimate population medians. The extent of overestimation is related directly to the amount of skew in the reaction time distributions and inversely to the size of the sample over which the median is computed. Simulations indicate that overestimation could approach 50 ms with small samples and highly skewed distributions. An important practical consequence of the bias in median reaction time is that sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions. If medians are used with unequal sample sizes, then the bias may produce an artifactual difference in conditions or conceal a true difference. Some recent studies of cuing and stimulus probability effects provide examples of this potential artifact.

N2  - A letter can be presented visually either by the abrupt appearance of lines that make up the letter (onset transient) or by the abrupt disappearance of extra lines from a form in which the letter is embedded (offset transient). Recent evidence from visual-search tasks has suggested that onset transients have absolute priority over offset transients with respect to the allocation of visual attention. In 2 experiments, a figure that included more offset-transient line segments in the offset-transient letters was used. Under these conditions, onset-transient targets did not pop out of a background of offset-transient distractors. It is suggested that visual attention may be influenced by total display change and, therefore, that onset transients are not necessarily sufficient to control attention when there are many competing offset transients.

N2  - In bimodal divided attention tasks, people respond faster to simultaneously presented redundant targets than to single targets. Previous research supports "coactivation" models, in which redundant targets both activate the response. This study sought to determine whether redundant targets activate the response independently, with each target producing its own activation, or interactively, with activation produced by redundant targets being a joint function of both their identities. Exp 1 used auditory targets varying in pitch and visual targets varying in location. Responses to redundant targets were faster when both were high or low than when they were incongruent. Exp 2 varied joint probability of redundant pairs, and responses were faster to common pairs than rare ones. The results indicate that responses to redundant targets are a joint function of both identities, not a concatenation of independent activations.

N2  - Examined the flanker compatibility effect (FCE) that occurs when Ss must respond to a relevant center letter and ignore irrelevant flanking letters. The flankers processed semantically at least to some extent, and this effect decreases as the separation between target and flankers increases. In 10 experiments with a total of 438 undergraduates, visual angle was the only task feature that had a strong influence on the size of the FCE. The invariance of the FCE across conditions suggests that the mechanism for early selection rarely completely excludes unattended stimuli from semantic analysis. In addition, selective mechanisms are relatively insensitive to several factors that might be expected to influence them, supporting the view that spatial separation has a special status for visual selective attention.

Because RT distributions are skewed, however, the computation of restricted means introduces a bias: The restricted mean underestimates the true average of the population of RTs. This problem may be very serious when comparing restricted means across conditions with different numbers of observations, because the bias increases with sample size. Simulations show that there is substantial differential bias (DB) when comparing conditions with fewer than 10 observations against conditions with more than 20. With strongly skewed distributions and a cutoff of 3.0 SDs, DB can influence comparisons of conditions with even more observations.

N2  - In studies of subliminal perception, a threshold for awareness is usually estimated for each S (e.g., the stimulus duration that yields chance discrimination performance). This article shows that if the Sś true threshold varies randomly from trial to trial, estimation of a fixed threshold has important consequences. Specifically, the estimated threshold approaches the minimum of the distribution of true thresholds, and the power of an experiment to detect subliminal perception is reduced. Because there is much evidence that true thresholds vary across trials, threshold variability may have seriously weakened previous experiments that tested for subliminal perception. Fortunately, it is possible to estimate the maximum power loss resulting from threshold variability and therefore to design an experiment with acceptable power even in the presence of variability.

N2  - Presents a new reaction time (RT) model that includes both sequential-stage (discrete) and overlapping-stage (continuous-flow) models as special cases. In the new model, task performance is carried out by a series of distinct processing stages, each of which functions as a queue. A stimulus conveys 1 or more distinct components of information (e.g., features), and each stage can begin processing as soon as it receives 1 component from its predecessor. If a stimulus activates only 1 component, successive stages operate in strict sequence; if it activates multiple components, successive stages operate with temporal overlap. Within this class of models, experimental factors affecting different processing stages always have additive effects on RT with sequential stages but rarely do so with overlapping stages. Within this class of models, then, observations of factor additivity support discrete-stage models.

Responses were faster and more accurate in high- than in low-probability trials. LRPs indicated that participants prepared the high-probability response and suggested that this preparation speeded high-probability responses relative to low-probability responses. When stimulus onset was temporally predictable, the high-probability response was clearly prepared prior to stimulus onset. When stimulus onset was unpredictable, preparation of the high-probability response occurred just after stimulus onset, even on low-probability trials where this preparation was inappropriate. With unpredictable stimulus onsets, RT distributions were adequately represented by a mixture model with prepared versus unprepared states; with predictable onsets, they were not.

N2  - Greenwald, Klinger, and Schuh (1995) investigated subliminal perception using a regression-based test for a dissociation between direct and indirect measures of perceptual ability. Direct and indirect measures were obtained for each observer, and a regression analysis was used to predict the amount of indirect perception at the point where the direct measure showed zero sensitivity. A significant positive intercept, obtained with both standard regression and a modified regression developed by Klauer, Draine, and Greenwald (1998), was used to argue for the key dissociation. When the assumptions of these methods are not met, however, simulations indicate that significant positive intercepts can often be obtained even if there is no dissociation. Moreover, the assumptions are theoretically implausible and inconsistent with some aspects of the results. Thus, the significant positive intercept is not strong evidence of the key dissociation.

N2  - Recent studies of redundancy gain indicate that it is especially large when redundant stimuli are presented to different hemispheres of an individual without a functioning corpus callosum. This suggests the hypothesis that responses to redundant stimuli are speeded partly because both hemispheres are involved in the activation of the response. A simple formal model incorporating this idea is developed and then elaborated to account for additional related findings. Predictions of the latter model are in good qualitative agreement with data from a number of sources, and there is neuroanatomic and psychophysiological support for its underlying structure.

N2  - Three experiments using psychological refractory period (PRP) tasks documented backward crosstalk effects in which the nature of the second-task response influenced first-task response latencies. Such effects are difficult to explain within currently popular bottleneck models, according to which second-task response selection does not begin until first-task response selection has finished. In Experiments 1 and 2, the first of the PRP tasks required a choice reaction time (RT) response, whereas the second task required a go/no-go decision. Task 1 responses were faster when the second task required a go response than when it required a no-go response. Experiment 3 showed that Task 1 RTs were also influenced by the complexity of second-task responses. These backward crosstalk effects indicate that significant second-task processing is carried out in time to influence first-task responses, and thus challenge strictly serial bottleneck models.

N2  - Three choice reaction time experiments documented a Simon-type congruence effect involving the numbers of stimuli and responses. In Experiment 1 the stimulus consisted of one or two high or low pitch tones, and participants were required to respond with one or two taps of a response key depending on stimulus pitch. Responses were faster when the number of tones matched the required number of response taps than when these numbers mismatched. Experiment 2 showed that a weaker version of this effect can also be obtained using visual stimuli, and Experiment 3 showed that the analogous effect can even be obtained, albeit very weakly, with bimodal stimuli. There was also evidence that the number of stimuli affected the rate of emitting the two-tap response. These results indicate that stimulus numerosity is processed automatically to the level at which it can affect the selection and possibly the execution of a varying number of responses.

N2  - Motor potentials contralateral versus ipsilateral to the responding hand were examined in a visual simple reaction time (RT) experiment in order to test the hemispheric coactivation model of Miller (Cogn Psychol 49:118-154, 2004). Visual stimuli were presented on the left side of fixation, on the right side, or on both sides, and in the RT task participants had to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of any stimulus. The same stimulus displays were also presented in a counting task, for which participants had merely to count the stimuli. Hemisphere-specific movement-related potentials contralateral and ipsilateral to the responding hand were isolated by subtracting count-task ERPs from RT-task ERPs. Consistent with the hemispheric coactivation model, there was evidence of movement-related ipsilateral positivity as well as contralateral negativity, suggesting that the motor areas of both hemispheres contribute to response initiation in simple RT. The distinction between contralateral and ipsilateral motor activation appears useful in clarifying the roles of the two hemispheres in response initiation.

N2  - In simple reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster when stimuli are presented to both the left and right visual hemifields than when a stimulus is presented to a single hemifield. Paradoxically, this redundancy gain with bilateral stimuli is enhanced in split-brain individuals relative to normals. This article reports three experiments testing an account of that enhancement in which normals ́responses to bilateral stimuli are slowed by interhemispheric inhibition. In simple RT tasks, normal participants responded bimanually to left, right, or bilateral visual stimuli. In choice RT tasks, they responded to each stimulus with one hand, responding bimanually only when both stimuli were presented. Measurements of response forcefulness (Experiment 1) and electroencephalographic activity (Experiments 2 and 3) showed no evidence for the patterns of negative correlations predicted by the hypothesis of interhemispheric inhibition. The results suggest that such inhibition is unlikely to be the explanation for enhanced redundancy gain in split-brain individuals.

N2  - "If an initial experiment produces a statistically significant effect, what is the probability that this effect will be replicated in a follow-up experiment?" I argue that this seemingly fundamental question can be interpreted in two very different ways and that its answer is, in practice, virtually unknowable under either interpretation. Although the data from an initial experiment can be used to estimate one type of replication probability, this estimate will rarely be precise enough to be of any use. The other type of replication probability is also unknowable, because it depends upon unknown aspects of the research context. Thus, although it would be nice to know the probability of replicating a significant effect, researchers must accept the fact that they generally cannot determine it, whichever type of replication probability they seek.

N2  - Event-related potentials were used to examine the preparation of hand and foot responses in tasks using both limb systems. As in tasks using only one system, opposite lateralized readiness potentials were observed for hand and foot responses (Experiment 1). Furthermore, movement-related activity at Cz was more positive prior to hand than foot responses, revealing that Cz activity can be used to index selective movement preparation by one limb system. In Experiment 2 two responses were cued prior to stimulus onset. Cue-related activity at Cz was more positive with hand than foot cuing, reinforcing the conclusion that Cz activity is sensitive to selective preparation for one of these limb systems. Overall, the results show that it is possible to carry out motor preparation of two responses within the same limb system and that differential Cz activity is a useful index of this preparation in tasks with hand versus foot movements.

Individual stimuli were presented at one corner of a square centered at fixation, and each response was made with the left or right hand or foot. In Experiment 1, the correct response was determined by stimulus location, whereas in Experiment 2 it was determined by stimulus identity. Horizontal and vertical compatibility affected both RT and response accuracy, but the LRP and LSP results suggested that compatibility had little or no direct effect on the duration of motor processes. In addition, the results suggest that the relatively new LSP measure is a useful index of motor activation processes. Its insensitivity to horizontal stimulus artifacts makes it especially useful for studying the effects of horizontal spatial compatibility.

N2  - As a supplement to Gondan and Minakataś (2015) tutorial on methods for testing the race model inequality, this theoretical note attempts to clarify further (a) the types of models that obey and violate the inequality, and (b) the conclusions that can be drawn when the inequality is violated. In particular, the idea that individual racers proceed at the same speed in the single and redundant conditions (also known as ``context independence) is shown to be better understood as an inherent part of Raabś (1962) original race model than as a separate, additional assumption. Thus, evidence that individual racers proceeded at different speeds in the single and redundant conditions, if available, should be viewed as supporting one type of coactivation model rather than an alternative model. In addition, it is shown that a class of race-like models without the assumption of context independence is so broad that it can never be falsified.

N2  - Response-selection bottleneck (RSB) models provide an important account of dual-task interference. These models are thought to have difficulty, however, explaining the commonly observed "backward compatibility effect" (BCE), which is the finding that the speed of first-task responses depends on their compatibility with later second-task responses. One explanation of this phenomenon is based on a distinction between an early response activation stage and a subsequent response selection stage (e.g., Hommel, 1998). The former stage is thought to be influenced by both tasks and to be responsible for BCEs, whereas the latter stage implements the RSB suggested to explain many aspects of dual-task interference. The present experiments measured lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) to test predictions of this early response activation account. The results are generally consistent with a distinction between response selection and response activation, but they suggest that BCEs arise because second-task stimuli influence first-task response selection rather than because these stimuli activate the second-task responses with which they are associated. Thus, the results support an account of BCEs that is even more consistent with RSB models than previous accounts.

In contrast to (a), I argue that the underlying logic of hypothesis testing is actually extremely straightforward and compelling. To substantiate that, I present examples showing that hypothesis testing logic is routinely used in everyday life. These same examples also refute (b) by showing circumstances in which the logic of hypothesis testing addresses a question of prime interest. NHST may sometimes be misunderstood or misapplied, but these problems should be addressed by improved education.

N2  - We propose a new sequential hypothesis testing procedure in which data are collected and analyzed in a series of independent segments. As in fixed-sample hypothesis testing and in previous sequential procedures, the overall level can be set to any desired value. Like other sequential procedures, the independent segments procedure generally requires smaller samples than fixed-sample procedures---often approximately 30% smaller---to achieve the same level and statistical power. Relative to other sequential procedures, the new method has the advantages that it is simpler to use, requires fewer assumptions, and can be used with a wider array of statistical tests. Thus, in some circumstances the independent segments procedure may provide an attractive option for increasing the efficiency of statistical testing.

N2  - Studied tachistoscopic perception of lines in structured figures. Previous research has shown that perception of lines is facilitated when the lines occur as parts of coherent 3-dimensional figures. Exp I, with 8 undergraduates, demonstrated that it is not necessary for the figure to be 3-dimensional to obtain facilitation. Exps II and III, with 32 and 8 Ss, respectively, showed that 3-dimensionality is not sufficient either. What is important is that the target lines be structurally relevant to the figure. However, structural relevance of a target segment to the figure as perceived with unlimited viewing time is not perfectly correlated with perceptibility under tachistoscopic conditions; it appears that the targets that fall on the external contour of a figure may be facilitated even without a high degree of structural relevance. In view of this, a model is suggested in which perceivers use processing heuristics to direct processing to aspects of the input that are potentially important for determining the structure of the final figure, working primarily from the outside in.

N2  - Response force (RF) was measured in a simple reaction time (RT) experiment varying response uncertainty by cuing the probability of the response on each trial. In all cases, RF decreased as response probability increased. The dependence of RF on response probability was insensitive to foreperiod length and to the use of loud auditory response signals, although the dependence of RT on response probability was sensitive to both of these manipulations. In combination with previous findings, these results provide evidence that RT and RF can be dissociated. We describe an extension of Naatanenś readiness model that can account for the effects of response probability on RF and RT. According to this model, the distance between motor activation and a threshold for action is relatively large when subjects are unprepared, and a large increment is needed to exceed this threshold, resulting in slow but forceful responses. A possible neurophysiological implementation of this model is suggested.

N2  - Mattes, UIrich, and Miller (1997) found that as response probability decreases in a simple reaction time (RT) task, participants produce more forceful responses as well as longer RTs, suggesting a direct influence of preparatory processes on the motor system. In this previous study, however, response probability was confounded with stimulus probability, leaving open the possibility that response force was sensitive to stimulus- rather than response-related preparation. The present study was conducted to unravel the effects of stimulus and response probability. Experiment 1 manipulated stimulus probability and revealed that responses to a more probable stimulus are less forceful than responses to a less probable stimulus even when both stimuli require the same response. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this stimulus probability effect does not depend on the overall level of response probability. Experiment 3 showed an analogous effect for response probability when stimulus probability is kept constant. The complete pattern of results suggests that both stimulus probability and response probability affect the forcefulness of a response. It is argued that response probability exerts a direct influence on the motor system, whereas stimulus probability influences the motor system indirectly via premotoric adjustments.

N2  - For a discrimination experiment, a plot of the hit rate against the false-alarm rate - the ROC curve - summarizes performance across a range of confidence levels. In many content areas, ROCs are well-described by a normal-distribution model and the z-transformed hit and false-alarm rates are approximately linearly related. We examined the sampling distributions of three parameters of this model when applied to a ratings procedure: the area under the ROC (Az), the normalized difference between the means of the underlying signal and noise distributions (da), and the slope of the ROC on z-coordinates (s). Statistical bias (the degree to which the mean of the sampling distribution differed from the true value) was trivial for Az, small but noticeable for da, and substantial for s. Variability of the sampling distributions decreased with the number of trials, and was also affected by the number of response categories available to the participant and the overall sensitivity level. Figures in the article and tables available online can be used to construct confidence intervals around ROC statistics and to test statistical hypotheses.

N2  - The mechanisms responsible for reaction time (RT) slowing in Parkinsonś disease (PD) were investigated using movement-related potentials in a choice RT task. PD patients and control subjects were required to respond with the left or right hand to indicate whether a visual stimulus was relatively large or small. The difficulty of the size discrimination was manipulated, as was the complexity of the manual response (single keypress versus sequence of three keypresses). Behavioral responses of PD patients were slower than those of control subjects, especially when complex responses were required. Moreover, the timing of movement-related potentials indicated that motor processes clearly required extra time, relative to control subjects, for PD patients making complex responses. In addition, delayed onset of the movement-related potentials indicated that one or more premotor processes are also slowed in these patients.

N2  - The present study examined whether the use of partial information for response preparation depends on the utility of that partial information for meeting task demands. Using a choice/Nogo task, the utility of the partial information was varied by manipulating the proportion of Go relative to Nogo signals, and preliminary response preparation was indexed by the degree of LRP activity on Nogo trials. The Nogo LRP was clearly present when Go probability was high (67% Go) and, to a lesser extent, when Go and Nogo signals were equiprobable. However, the Nogo LRP disappeared when the probability of a Go signal was low (25% Go). This pattern of results supports the hypothesis set forth by Coles, De Jong, Gehring, and Gratton (1991: Event-Related Brain Research, Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, suppl. 42, pp. 260-269) that response preparation will be based on partial stimulus information only when the information has significant utility in the context of the overall task requirements.

N2  - Five psychological refractory period (PRP) experiments were conducted with an especially time-consuming first task (Experiments 1, 3, and 5: mental rotation; Experiments 2 and 4: memory scanning) as well as equal task emphasis on the first and the second task (left-right tone-judgment). The standard design with varying stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) was extended by a condition with blocked SOAs in Experiments 3 and 4. Based on the optimization account (J. Miller, R. Ulrich, & B. Rolke, 2009) it was expected that participants would -- at short, but not at long SOAs -- tend to process the relatively fast central stage of Task 2 before the time-consuming central stage of Task 1 and consequently emit the response to Task 2 before the response to Task 1. Actually, such an optimization tendency was found, more so for the mental rotation task and for the blocked SOA condition. The results indicate that preparation, Task 1 characteristics, and TRT (total reaction time) optimization are -- amongst others -- factors influencing central processing order in PRP-tasks.

N2  - This article reports four subliminal perception experiments using the relationship between confidence and accuracy to assess awareness. Subjects discriminated among stimuli and indicated their confidence in each discrimination response. Subjects were classified as being aware of the stimuli if their confidence judgments predicted accuracy and as being unaware if they did not. In the first experiment, confidence predicted accuracy even at stimulus durations so brief that subjects claimed to be performing at chance. This finding indicates that subjectsś claims that they are "just guessing" should not be accepted as sufficient evidence that they are completely unaware of the stimuli. Experiments 2-4 tested directly for subliminal perception by comparing the minimum exposure duration needed for better-than-chance discrimination performance against the minimum needed for confidence to predict accuracy. The latter durations were slightly but significantly longer, suggesting that under certain circumstances people can make perceptual discriminations even though the information that was used to make those discriminations is not consciously available.

In each trial, participants were signaled to respond bimanually with the two index fingers or the two middle fingers. After a short delay, a stop signal was sometimes presented, indicating that one of the two finger responses should be withheld. A given response was slowed when the response on the other hand was stopped, replicating a previously observed stopping interference effect. In addition, the given response was also made more forcefully when the response on the other hand was stopped, indicating that the requirement to stop one activated response has global motor-level consequences for other responses that are to be carried out normally.

N2  - In our ability to selectively inhibit a subset of concurrent response tendencies, referred to as selective response inhibition, stopping-interference (SI) effects have been found and attributed to global inhibitory processes. In the standard stop-signal paradigm, the stop signal might not only signal stopping but also produce other effects simply by virtue of being an additional signal. Therefore, we investigated whether previously observed SI effects reflect not only selective response inhibition but also other effects caused by the appearance of the stop signal. In Exp 1, we controlled for the possible extra influences of the stop signal and still found SI effects, allowing a more confident attribution of SI effects to global inhibitory processes. Furthermore, the extra signal affected the motor system, as revealed by a reduction of SI effects on response force after the improved control. Using the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), Exp 2 showed that the extra signal affected relatively central motor processing. The findings thus advance our knowledge about the distinction between signal-related and motor-inhibitory effects in stop-signal tasks.

N2  - Our performance on a task decreases when the task is in a dual-task situation than when it is in isolation. An important experimental setting for dual-task situation is the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, and the dual-task performance decrements in the PRP paradigm is referred to as PRP interference. The standard response selection bottleneck (RSB) models states that the response selection stage of the second task (T2) cannot start until the response selection stage of the first task (T1) finishes, resulting in the PRP interference. Contrary to the prediction of RSB models, several researchers have found T2ś modulations on T1ś performance, and have suggested that T1ś selection-related processes are affected by T2ś selection-related processes, referred to as backward crosstalk effects. The locus of backward crosstalk effects is not clear, however, because RTs were measured in most previous studies. By using semantically unrelated stimuli and responses and by measuring T1ś lateralized readiness potential (LRP), we examined the locus of backward crosstalk effects. We found that the interval between T1ś stimulus onset and the stimulus-locked LRP onset was affected, suggesting T2ś response selection starts before T1ś selection is complete. The present result provided electrophysiological evidence focusing on T1ś changes in favour of the hypothesis of parallel response selection in the PRP paradigm.

N2  - The forcefulness of key press responses was measured in stop-all and selective stopping versions of the stop-signal paradigm. When stop signals were presented too late for participants to succeed in stopping their responses, response force was nonetheless reduced relative to trials in which no stop signal was presented. This effect shows that peripheral motor aspects of primary task responses can still be influenced by inhibition even when the stop signal arrives too late to prevent the response. It thus requires modification of race models in which responses in the presence of stop signals are either stopped completely or produced normally, depending on whether the responding or stopping process finishes first.

N2  - In simple, go/no-go, and choice reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster to two redundant targets than to a single target. This redundancy gain has been explained in terms of a race model assuming that whichever target is processed faster determines RT (Raab, 1962). Miller (1982) presented a race model inequality to test the race model by comparing the RT distributions of single and redundant target conditions. Here, we present simulations indicating that the standard tests of this inequality (for a description of the testing algorithm, see Ulrich, Miller, & Schroeter, in press) are afflicted with systematic biases and Type I error accumulation. Systematic biases tend to produce violations of the race model inequality, but they decrease as the numbers of observations increase. Reasonably unbiased tests of the race model inequality are obtained for sample sizes of at least 20 for each target condition. In addition, Type I error accumulates because of testing the inequality at multiple percentiles. To reduce Type I error, the race model inequality should be tested in a restricted range of percentiles, preferably in the percentile range 10% to 25%.

In general, the jackknife-based approach combined with the relative criterion technique or combined with the fractional area technique (Luck, 2005) provided the most accurate method and the greatest statistical power, with no inflation of Type I error rate.

In order to investigate which processes are affected by accessory stimuli, we presented accessory tones in a simple RT task while varying the contingencies between accessory stimulation and either responses (Experiment 1) or stimulus conditions (Experiment 2). Accessory tones speeded up responding to a larger degree when they were conjointly presented within Go compared to No-go trials. In contrast, contingency variation with stimulus conditions did not alter the impact of accessory stimuli. Additionally, accessory tones increased response force. Thus, we conclude that accessory tones influence response-related and not perceptual processes.

N2  - Many reaction time (RT) experiments have tested for response-level probability effects. Their results have been mixed, which is surprising because psychophysiological studies provide clear evidence of motor-level changes associated with an anticipated response. A survey of the designs used in the RT studies reveals many potential problems that could conceal the effects of response probability. We report five new RT experiments testing for response-level probability effects with the most promising of the previous designs --- that of Blackman (1972) --- and with new designs. Some of these experiments yield evidence of response-level probability effects, but others do not. It appears that response-level probability effects are present primarily in simple tasks with a strong emphasis on response preparation, possibly because participants only expend effort on response preparation in these tasks.

In Exp 1, Ss took significantly longer to respond to upright characters in blocks containing rotated stimuli than in blocks containing only upright stimuli. Exps 2 and 3 showed that this rotational uncertainty effect was not caused by the need to determine stimulus orientation, and Exp 4 showed that it was independent of the visual quality of the stimulus. Exp 5 showed that the effect was greatly reduced when Ss performed a go/no-go task rather than choice reaction time, and Exp 6 showed that it was independent of the complexity of the response required in the choice task. Results suggest that response selection in a choice RT mirror-normal discrimination task is altered when mental rotation is added, violating the assumption of pure insertion.

Experiment 1 presented subjects with a colored letter on each trial. Color determined which hand might respond and the letterś membership in a memory set determined whether that response should be made or withheld. Electrophysiological data suggested that hand-specific motor preparation was not initiated until memory scanning was finished. Experiment 2 replicated these results even though subjects were given a substantial amount of item-specific practice using a consistent stimulus-response mapping to make the scanning process easier. Experiment 3 tested for earlier response priming with a probe RT paradigm, and the results suggested that color information can be used to select a response before memory scanning is finished. The results of Experiments 1-3 suggest that interference between memory scanning and response preparation preclude the concurrent operation of these processes.

N2  - Previous data (Ilan & Miller, 1998) suggest that motoric response preparation cannot be initiated in parallel with memory scanning, but leave open the possibility that it may continue in parallel with memory scanning once it has been initiated. The present study examined whether such response preparation can be maintained or continued while memory scanning is in progress. Lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were measured in a modified memory scanning task. In Experiment 1, each trial began with the presentation of a colored precue that indicated which hand might be needed to respond. The memory set membership of a letter appearing 700 ms later determined whether the primed response should be made or withheld. Response preparation was initiated by the precue before the letter appeared. More important, LRP amplitude continued to increase after the letter was presented, suggesting that once response preparation had been initiated it was continued in parallel with memory scanning. Experiment 2 investigated whether the difficulty of the concurrent memory search affects the rate at which LRP amplitude increases. The S-R mapping in the memory scanning task was changed from consistent to varied to increase cognitive demands. The findings of Experiment 1 were replicated, and comparisons across experiments suggested that the difficulty of the concurrent process has little effect on the continuation of response preparation. Considered in conjunction with previous findings, these results support the view that motoric response preparation consists of at least two qualitatively distinct phases--initiation and continuation.

N2  - Several variants of a precued reaction time experiment were performed to assess preparation for Choice (Donders ́type B) or Go/No-Go (type C) reaction tasks. On each trial, the imperative stimulus could necessitate either a keypress with the left forefinger, the right forefinger, or no response. A precue given at lead times of 50-750 ms either informed the subject whether the task was a type B task (left or right forefinger response), a type C task (e.g., left forefinger or No Go), or carried no information (all three possibilities remained open). The noninformative cue produced minor facilitation of reaction time at long lead times only. At lead times of 50-250 ms, the other two precues speeded reactions by about 50 ms. At precue intervals of 400-750 ms, Go/No-Go reactions averaged 25 ms faster than Choice reactions in an experiment which utilized appropriate controls for stimulus and task parameters. The mixed-trial design rules out gross motor (e.g., postural) adjustments as an explanation for the advantage of C over B reactions. An interpretation in terms of a two-stage theory of motor preparation is discussed.

N2  - Examined the fundamental properties of a new tool in cognitive electrophysiology, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). Exp 1 (n = 14) resolved an apparent inconsistency in the literature by demonstrating that this response-specific lateralization is larger preceding complex then preceding simple finger movements. In Exp 2 (n = 20), the foveally presented precue, which indicated hand of response, preceded the go/no-go stimulus by 0, 100, 300, or 1,400 msec. Analyses of LRP latency indicated that hand-specific preparation began earlier with longer foreperiods but was temporally linked to the reaction stimulus as well as the precue. Although the degree of lateralization did not predict reaction speed in either study, a nonlateralized, response-locked negativity was larger prior to faster reactions.

N2  - Proposes a classification scheme that integrates previous outcome studies in psychotherapy. Studies are classified into 1 of 3 frameworks according to the question addressed, the assumptions made, and the experimental designs used. Strengths and weaknesses of the 3 frameworks are examined within the context of specific studies of outcome. Evidence from the 3 frameworks suggests an alternative formulation of the question about outcome and a new experimental design. Specifically, the design involves evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy with respect to a population of patients deemed appropriate for psychotherapy. This design avoids random assignment of patient to psychotherapist and permits the investigator to address the question of whether psychotherapists are effective with patients whom they regard as appropriate for their particular type of therapeutic intervention.

N2  - Tested a corollary of the gestalt hypothesis, that feature conjunctions are stored in transient auditory memory. The mismatch negativity (MMN), an event related potential (ERP) that is elicited by stimuli that differ from a series of preceding stimuli, was evaluated in 10 Ss (aged 21-45 yrs). A tone that differed from the preceding series of stimuli in the conjunction of 2 of its features, both present in preceding stimuli but in different combinations, was found to elicit the MMN. The data are interpreted as confirming that information about the conjunction of features is stored in the memory.

N2  - Previous research investigated effects of response readiness in neurologically-normal subjects by manipulating probability of responding. With a high probability of responding, reaction time (RT) is fast and the level of response force is low, compared to conditions with a low probability of responding. An elaborated view of response readiness assumes that these effects reflect properties associated with the transmission of response activation to the motor output system. The present study employed high and low probability trials in a go-no/go task, to investigate whether these processes are impaired in people with mild to moderate Parkinsonś Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that the patients would demonstrate abnormal patterns of response force with manipulations on response readiness. It was further hypothesized that the patients would display evidence of an inability to inhibit responses on no/go trials. Both hypotheses were supported, suggesting that a basic deficit associated with PD is related to the transmission of response activation to the motor system. Response modulation appears to depend on the integrity of basal ganglia structures.

N2  - Redundancy gain (RG) is a well-known effect in the experimental psychology literature which is thought to reflect integration of sensory information. RG is a facilitation in speed of responding on a detection task when two stimuli are presented at once compared to when one stimulus is presented alone. Even though sensorimotor tasks involving integration of sensory information form the basis of a large repertoire of human skilled actions, the neural basis of reliable effects such as RG remains elusive. The present study examines whether the integrity of the basal ganglia system is likely to be critical for RG effects to occur. Based on a thorough analysis of performance on a standard paradigm of RG (and on the related paradigm of crossed-uncrossed differences: CUDs) in patients with mild to moderate Parkinsonś disease and matched controls, we found virtually no differences between groups. We conclude that normal RG and CUD effects are not likely to rely critically on the BG.

N2  - In this dual-task study we applied both crosstalk logic and locus of slack logic to test whether participants can retrieve semantic categories in Task 2 in parallel to Task 1 bottleneck processing. Whereas crosstalk logic can detect parallel memory retrieval only in conditions of categorical overlap between tasks, the locus of slack approach is independent of such restrictions. As expected, using the crosstalk logic we found clear evidence for parallel retrieval of semantic categories when there was categorical overlap between tasks (Experiment 1). Locus of slack based evidence for parallel semantic retrieval was found, however, both in conditions with (Experiment 1) and without categorical overlap between tasks (Experiment 2). Crucially, however, increasing the demand for resources required to switch from Task 1 to Task 2 eliminated even the locus of slack based evidence for parallel memory retrieval in PRP (Experiment 3). Together, our results suggest that parallel retrieval is not bound to conditions of categorical overlap between tasks, but instead is contingent upon resources needed for switching between tasks (e.g., Oriet, Tombu, & Jolicoeur, 2005).

N2  - In size and parity judgement tasks we investigated whether the activation of numerical quantity exerts an influence on motor response parameters such as response force. Results showed typically strong effects on reaction time of numerical distance in the size judgement task (Experiments 1 and 2) and SNARC compatibility (Experiment 1) in both tasks, indicating that semantic quantity representations were activated. Response force, however, varied at most weakly with the numerical magnitudes of the digits. Our results place limits on previously suggested interconnections of the magnitude and response systems. Activations within the magnitude system seem to have a strong influence on the initiation and selection of which action to produce, but only a little influence on the dynamics of response production (i.e., response execution).

N2  - In a visual simple reaction time paradigm with attention divided between the left and right visual fields, redundancy gain refers to the finding of faster responses to stimuli presented in both fields than to single stimuli. The present study investigated whether effects of low level perceptual processing affect the redundancy gain by comparing detection of onsets versus offsets. In different blocks participants responded to left and right visual field stimuli that either appeared (onset) or disappeared (offset), with a single stimulus change in some trials and two redundant stimulus changes in others. With onset stimuli, the results replicated previous redundancy gain effects. In contrast, there was much less redundancy gain when participants responded to stimulus offsets. This finding suggests that redundancy gain is sensitive to low level perceptual characteristics such as onset vs. offset presentation of stimuli.

N2  - When a single brief flash is accompanied by two auditory beeps, participants often report perceiving two flashes. The present experiment examined whether or not the perception of illusory redundant flashes can result in faster responses as compared to the perception of a single flash, because previous research has shown such a redundancy gain for physical stimuli. To this end, participants were asked to respond as rapidly as possible to the onset of any flash. Following their response, they additionally indicated whether they perceived a single flash or a double-flash. Most importantly, we observed significant shorter reaction times in response to redundant flashes, irrespective of whether they were physically presented or illusorily perceived. Taken together, our results suggest that an illusory percept can affect simple reaction time in much the same manner as the corresponding physical stimulation.

N2  - Delta plots with negative-going slopes (nDPs) reflect the phenomenon that an RT difference between two conditions is greater for relatively fast than for relatively slow responses. This unusual distributional pattern has predominantly been observed in the spatial Simon task, where it has been interpreted as reflecting the selective inhibition of an automatically activated response. Literature suggesting that a similar fading mechanism influences RTs in masked identity priming inspired us to check an analogous semantic priming paradigm for nDPs.  Consistent with the findings in other paradigms, two masked semantic priming experiments revealed stronger priming effects for relatively fast than for relatively slow responses, thus reflecting a nDP.  These findings are compatible with the ideas that the activation produced by masked semantic primes decreases over the course of a trial, like that of irrelevant spatial information and of masked identity primes, and that nDPs are a general signature of within-trial decreases in response activation across different tasks and paradigms.

N2  - Utilized a concurrent discrimination paradigm with 17 Ss in 2 experiments to study the effects of visual attention on psychophysical judgments and the consistency of these effects with a sample-size model in which attention influences the variance of the internal representation used to make psychophysical judgments. In Exp 1, the relationship between attention and discrimination accuracy was consistent with the sample-size model when attentional allocation varied from trial to trial and when it varied between blocks. Discriminations were more accurate overall with varied than with blocked attentional allocation. Besides supporting the sample-size model, the results of Exp 2 suggest that criterion variance is at least as large as sensory variance and that criterion but not sensory variance increases with stimulus variance.

N2  - In a study by Zwaan and Yaxley (2003, Cognition, 87, B79--B86), participants judged the semantic relatedness of word pairs presented one above the other either in the left or right visual field with all related pairs requiring right-handed responses. If the vertical orientation of the word pairs matched their referents ́typical vertical orientation ("roof" above "basement") a match effect was observed, but only when the word pair was presented in the left visual field. We replicated this study with response side as an additional factor and found a main effect of match, as well as a Simon effect with faster responses when the required response matched the visual field in which the word pair was presented. We did not, however, observe an interaction between the match effect and the visual field. This challenges the assumption that coarse semantic representations, including spatial properties of objects, are mainly processed in the right hemisphere.

N2  - Three experiments with 108 undergraduates examined stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility relationships with the stimulus array perpendicular to the response array. In Exps I and II, stimuli indicated right and left positions, while the responses were movements up and down. The mapping right/up and left/down was preferable for the right hand, but the reverse mapping was preferable for the left hand. In Exp III, the stimuli indicated up and down positions, while the responses were movements to the right and left. In this case, the mapping up/left and down/right was preferable for the right hand, and the reverse mapping was preferable for the left hand. Results are most easily explained by assuming that counterclockwise rotational movements are preferable for the right hand, while clockwise is preferable for the left. These preferences are manifest through combinations of implicit movements toward the stimulus and explicit movements toward the response key. This principle provides a simpler explanation for some previously reported S compatibility effects.

N2  - Reaction times (RTs) and lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) were studied to find out whether response preparation begins after mental rotation finishes, as assumed by discrete-stage models. Stimuli were disoriented normal or mirror-image characters, with character name determining which hand would respond. In Experiment 1, the normal/mirror-image information determined whether the response was to be executed (go) or withheld (no-go), and LRPs indicated that responses were weakly prepared before the end of mental rotation. Mental rotation was not required in Experiment 2, and significantly more response preparation was observed. In Experiment 3, probe RT trials embedded in the mental rotation task indicated that hand information is available to the response preparation process during rotation. Apparently, some response preparation occurs before mental rotation finishes, but rotation interferes with response preparation.

N2  - When people must respond discriminatively to one or two stimuli by making one or two taps of a response key, they initiate the response more rapidly when the correct number of taps matches the number of stimuli (compatible condition) than when it mismatches (incompatible condition; Miller, Atkins, & Van Nes, 2005). In the Miller et al. (2005) studies, there was also sometimes an effect of compatibility on response execution time, as reflected in the interresponse intervals between successive taps. We report two further experiments generalizing the numerosity compatibility effects on response initiation time and interresponse intervals to two- versus three-stimulus sequences. In addition, we varied gap length between stimuli to see whether the rhythm of the stimulus would influence that of the response. Weak rhythmicity effects were repeatedly found, but these were too small to suggest a plausible alternative explanation for the numerosity compatibility effect on response initiation time.
