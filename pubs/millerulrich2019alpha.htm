	 Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance
	 testing must choose a critical ``alpha'' level, &alpha;, to use as a cutoff for deciding
	 whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most
	 fields, &alpha;=0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many
	 researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such
	 as &alpha;=0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate
	 of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other
	 researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend
	 to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be
	 used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and
	 increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal &alpha; level
	 depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although
	 &alpha;=0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic
	 situations, the optimal &alpha; could actually be substantially larger or smaller in
	 other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what
	 characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument
	 for using one &alpha; level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a
	 blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular &alpha; level.
