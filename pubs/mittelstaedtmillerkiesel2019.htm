      <p> Findings from studies using the voluntary task switching (VTS) paradigm
	 (Arrington &amp; Logan, 2004) suggest that task selection in multitasking can be influenced
	 by both cognitive and environmental constraints. In the present study, we used an
	 adaptive VTS paradigm to directly test whether and how people adapt to these two
	 constraints when they are instructed to optimize their task performance. In five
	 experiments, the availabilities of stimuli for two tasks in a trial changed predictably
	 because the stimulus needed for a task repetition appeared with an SOA that increased
	 linearly with the number of repetitions. Experiments 1a and 1b demonstrated that
	 stimulus availability did not automatically induce switching behavior. Experiment 2
	 showed that the predictable external constraints were accommodated in
	 participants' switching behavior once participants overcame their
	 reluctance to switch tasks. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that both switch costs and
	 switch rates were influenced by manipulating the time between trials. Moreover, switch
	 costs and switch rates were correlated across all experiments; and when the time for
	 advanced preparation of task selection was limited (Experiment 1a, 1b, and certain
	 conditions of Experiments 3 and 4), the SOA in task switches approximately matched
	 switch costs. Together, these results point to a link between task selection and
	 performance indicating that participants adapt their task selection behavior to mutual
	 effects of external and internal influences on task performance. We propose that both
	 task selection and task performance can be integrated within a framework of competing
	 multiple task-set activations. </p>
