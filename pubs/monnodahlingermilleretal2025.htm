	 Recent research on voluntary task switching indicates that people have different strategies for selecting tasks in order to effectively manage the multitasking constraints. In this study, we conducted two experiments to investigate individual task selection behavior and provide empirical evidence for two theoretically derived local versus global strategies aimed at balancing the time-related costs in a self-organized task switching paradigm. Specifically, we implemented a delay for the stimulus required for task repetition, i.e., stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA), which increased with each consecutive repetition until a task switch reset the SOA. Consequently, repeating the same task required waiting, whereas switching tasks incurred performance costs. We examined the individual waiting times at which participants decided to switch tasks (switch SOA) and their task performance (switch costs) in different experimental conditions. The results revealed that some participants had switch SOAs approximately similar to their switch costs, consistent with the local strategy, while other participants had considerably smaller switch SOAs compared to their switch costs. These latter individuals aligned their cost balancing with the global strategy, presumably taking into consideration the fact that in this paradigm task switching reduces waiting times in subsequent trials following a task switch. Importantly, our visual observations of individual behavioral patterns were confirmed with the Expectation Maximization (EM) method, which is sometimes used in machine learning, providing statistical evidence for the existence of these two strategies. Overall, the present findings suggest that individuals differ in their preferred individual task selection strategies with the individual preference remaining relatively stable across varying experimental conditions.
