	 In simple reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster when stimuli are presented to both the left and right visual hemifields than when a stimulus is presented to a single hemifield. Paradoxically, this redundancy gain with bilateral stimuli is enhanced in split-brain individuals relative to normals. This article reports three experiments testing an account of that enhancement in which normals' responses to bilateral stimuli are slowed by interhemispheric inhibition. In simple RT tasks, normal participants responded bimanually to left, right, or bilateral visual stimuli. In choice RT tasks, they responded to each stimulus with one hand, responding bimanually only when both stimuli were presented. Measurements of response forcefulness (Experiment 1) and electroencephalographic activity (Experiments 2 and 3) showed no evidence for the patterns of negative correlations predicted by the hypothesis of interhemispheric inhibition. The results suggest that such inhibition is unlikely to be the explanation for enhanced redundancy gain in split-brain individuals.
