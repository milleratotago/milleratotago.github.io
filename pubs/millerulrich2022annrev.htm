	 Recent evidence suggests that research practices in psychology and many other disciplines are far less effective than has previously been assumed, leading to what has been called a "crisis of confidence" in psychological research (e.g., Pashler &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012). In response to the perceived crisis, standard research practices have come under intense scrutiny, and various changes in these practices have been suggested to improve the situation. The burgeoning field of metascience seeks to use standard quantitative data-gathering and modelling techniques to understand the reasons for inefficiency, to assess the likely effects of suggested changes, and ultimately to tell psychologists how to do better science. We review the pros and cons of suggested changes, highlighting the many complex research trade-offs that must be addressed to identify better methods.
