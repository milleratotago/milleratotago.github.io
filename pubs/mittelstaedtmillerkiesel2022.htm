      <p> Previous studies have suggested that people are sensitive to anticipated
	 cognitive processing demands when deciding which task to perform, but the influence of
	 perceptual processing demands on voluntary task choice is still unclear. The present
	 study tested whether voluntary task choice behavior may be influenced by unpredictable
	 task-specific perceptual processing demands. Across four experiments using different
	 voluntary task choice procedures, we randomly varied the perceptual discriminability of
	 stimuli (easy vs. hard color discrimination) for one of the two tasks. We reasoned that
	 people could only reactively adjust their task choice behavior to the unpredictable
	 discriminability manipulation if they engaged in some perceptual processing before a
	 task goal becomes sufficiently activated to select the task for further processing. The
	 results confirmed this hypothesis: Task performance data demonstrated the presence of
	 perceptual (discriminability effects) and cognitive (switch costs) processing demands.
	 Participants' choice behavior was affected by both types of processing demands (as
	 reflected in a task repetition bias and a bias to select the color task with easy
	 compared to hard discriminations). Thus, the present findings indicate that both
	 perceptual and cognitive processing demands influence voluntary task choice behavior.
	 We propose that higher-level goal activations interact at least partially with early
	 perceptual processes to influence task choice behavior, suggesting a locus of voluntary
	 choices during or after the perceptual stage within the information-processing stream. </p>
