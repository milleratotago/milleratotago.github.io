	    <em>Otago project students. </em>There are often suitable projects for 3rd-year, 4th-year, and masters students, in one of the areas listed under <a href="#Interests">Research Topics</a>. Stop by if you are interested. 
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <em>Overseas students. </em>It is sometimes possible to arrange 6-12 month visits for overseas students who want to get research experience in my lab, but you must get support from your home country. If you have support and are interested in one of my <a href="#Interests">Research Topics</a>, get in touch with me by regular- or e-mail.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <em>Prospective PhD students. </em>I am always happy to consider PhD students who want to work on topics related to the other research in my lab. If you are interested in working on such a project and have an appropriate background for PhD work in cognitive psychology, please get in touch with me by e-mail for further information. 
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <em>Post-doctoral students. </em>At present I cannot provide support for any post-doctoral students, but I would welcome inquiries from prospective post-docs seeking to apply for their own funds.
