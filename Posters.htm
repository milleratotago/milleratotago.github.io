		  A popular conception of science holds that real phenomena should always be replicable
		  when the appropriate conditions are met. Unfortunately, this conception does not hold
		  in scientific fields with inherently probabilistic measurements; in such fields, real
		  phenomena do sometimes fail to replicate. Simple statistical models can illuminate
		  why such errors occur and how their probabilities can be computed, while also
		  clarifying two distinct views of “replication probability”. The models also reveal
		  what quantities are needed to determine the probability of a successful replication.
		  The difficulty of getting good estimates of these quantities makes it hard to
		  determine whether recently observed—and much publicized—replication failures are “as
		  expected” or should instead be regarded as signs of flawed scientific practices.

		  Within the hypothesis testing framework, total research payoff can be viewed as the
		  sum of positive scientific contributions accruing from correct decisions (i.e., true
		  positives and negatives) minus negative contributions from incorrect decisions (i.e.,
		  false positives and negatives). We present a simple mathematical model that can be
		  used to quantify expected research payoffs, and we used it to compare expected
		  payoffs from three different strategies for hypothesis testing. One strategy was the
		  standard or canonical version of null hypothesis significance testing as it is almost
		  universally employed, and the other two strategies were straightforward modifications
		  of it. The results indicate that the modified strategies lead to much greater
		  expected research payoffs than the canonical one—approximately 1.5 times as
		  large—which suggests that research efficiency can be substantially increased by
		  shifting to one of the new strategies in situations where they are appropriate. The
		  findings illustrate the utility of having an explicit model to measure research
		  payoffs, and they open up the possibility of further enhancing research efficiency by
		  systematically investigating alternative research strategies.

		  Hypothesis testing requires a critical ``alpha'' level, traditionally &alpha;=.05, as a
		  cutoff for deciding whether a data set demonstrates a particular effect. Recently,
		  many have argued for changing to the more stringent &alpha;=0.005 cutoff, which would tend
		  to reduce the rate of false positives. Unfortunately, however, this change would
		  simultaneously tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple
		  mathematical model for research payoff can be used to assess the tradeoff between
		  false positives and false negatives and to identify the optimal &alpha; level. The payoff
		  model makes it clear what characteristics of the research area determines the optimal
		  &alpha; level, and it thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to find the
		  optimal &alpha; level for use in their area. In particular, it is clear that &alpha;=0.05 is
		  indeed approximately the optimal value in some areas, but the optimal &alpha; would be
		  substantially larger or smaller in other areas.

		  Theories of embodied cognition suggest that the recognition of action-related words activates

		  Vertical and horizontal spatial congruence (Simon) effects were examined with
		  reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) in a 4-choice task
		  with left and right hand and foot responses.  Irrelevantly, each stimulus
		  appeared in one of four positions—above or below fixation and to its left or

		  effects. RTs showed approximately equal effects of horizontal and vertical
		  congruence, both for hand and foot responses, and these congruence effects
		  were strongly under-additive. Stimulus- and response-locked motor-related ERPs
		  were examined for effects of spatial congruence on the duration of motor
		  processing. To avoid confounding with stimulus-related asymmetries, the effect
		  of vertical congruence was assessed in ERPs with the lateralized readiness
		  potential, which differentiates responses made with left and right sides of

		  Theories of embodied cognition suggest that the recognition of action-related

		  increased activation of the particular motor areas associated with specific

		  to foot- than hand-related action words. In addition, distinct event-related

		  Temporal preparation usually results in enhanced performance in a variety of

		  either a visual or an auditory discrimination task within a variable

		  "Redundancy gain" refers to the common finding that people tend to perform
		  better when presented with redundant targets than with single targets. Most
		  work using redundant targets has involved low-level tasks, but analogous
		  phenomena have sometimes been observed in tasks requiring higher-order
		  processing. We conducted experiments using a semantic categorisation task with
		  redundant stimuli in some trials. Participants saw two briefly presented words
		  and decided whether at least one belonged to a target category. Responses were
		  faster and more accurate when two members of the target category were
		  presented. We compare two possible accounts of these findings: a "race model"
		  (e.g., Raab, 1962) in which RT in redundant trials is determined by the
		  quicker of the two targets being processed; and a coactivation model,
		  according to which activation in the target category's neural representation
		  is greater with redundant than with single-target presentation (e.g., Mohr et

		  Subjective reports about temporal order-especially the times of conscious

		  Responses are usually faster when they are signaled by two redundant
		  stimuli than when they are signaled by a single stimulus, and this speedup is
		  known as "redundancy gain" (RG). Three experiments provide evidence that RG
		  results primarily from the speedup of motor processes. The first experiment
		  shows equal RG in simple RT, go/no-go, and choice tasks, suggesting that RG
		  affects a process common to all three tasks (i.e., stimulus detection or
		  response execution). The second experiment shows that RG is independent of
		  stimulus eccentricity, suggesting that it does not affect stimulus detection,
		  and also shows that it increases with bimanual rather than unimanual
		  responses, suggesting an effect on response execution. The third experiment
		  shows that the time from the onset of the lateralized readiness potential to
		  the key press response is shortened with redundant stimuli, also suggesting an
		  effect on response execution.

		  In simple RT, responses are faster when two stimuli are presented than when
		  one is—an example of "redundancy gain." Models of redundancy gain typically
		  assume that two stimuli cause faster accumulation of sensory evidence, thus
		  satisfying a response criterion more rapidly when both are presented. That
		  account predicts that, all other things being equal, redundancy gain should be
		  larger when the response criterion is higher. We tested this prediction in two
		  experiments manipulating the response criterion. One experiment compared
		  blocks of trials with infrequent versus frequent catch trials, assuming that
		  observers would set a higher criterion when catch trials were frequent. The
		  other experiment compared blocks including no-stimulus catch trials against
		  blocks including a distractor stimulus in catch trials, assuming that
		  observers would set a higher criterion in the latter blocks to avoid
		  incorrectly responding to distractors. The results have implications for
		  models of redundancy gain.

		  display (Experiment 1), or to expect them in the upper or lower half of the
		  display (Experiment 2).  Approximately 1 sec after the cue, one imperative
		  stimulus or two redundant imperative stimuli appeared in either the expected
		  or the unexpected half of the visual display.  We report both RT and response
		  force measures, and we discuss the implications of the results for mechanisms
		  of visual attention and redundancy gain.

		  Two of the possible mechanisms that have been put forward to explain precuing
		  effects are signal enhancement and uncertainty reduction. Signal enhancement
		  leads to processing advantages for valid information because the signal at the
		  known input channel is enhanced, whereas uncertainty reduction allows
		  observers to ignore confusing distractor items in a display. Both mechanisms
		  have been reported to be involved in location precuing, but it is still
		  unclear which of these two mechanisms is responsible for color cuing effects.
		  Two experiments are reported in which expectancy for a certain color in a
		  single-item display was created. Targets were presented briefly and masked. If
		  color cues produce signal enhancement, then a color cuing effect should
		  result.  If color cues only allow uncertainty reduction, however, there should
		  be no color cuing effect because there are no distractors in single-item
		  displays. The results of both experiments favor uncertainty reduction as the
		  mechanism behind color cuing, because no signs of signal enhancement-based
		  cueing effects were observed.

		  Auditory redundancy gains were assessed in three experiments using a simple
		  reaction time task. In each trial an auditory stimulus was presented either
		  to the left ear, to the right ear, or simultaneously to both ears. The
		  physical difference between auditory stimuli presented to the two ears was
		  systematically increased across experiments. No redundancy gains were
		  observed when the stimuli were identical pure tones (Exp. 1) or pure tones
		  of different frequencies (Exp. 2). A clear redundancy gain and evidence of
		  coactivation was obtained, however, when one stimulus was a pure tone and
		  the other was white noise (Exp. 3). The results extend previous findings
		  of redundancy gains and coactivation with visual and bimodal stimuli to
		  the auditory modality. Furthermore, at least within this modality, the
		  results indicate that redundancy gains do not emerge when redundant
		  stimuli are integrated into a single percept.

		  In typical PRP experiments, the processing demands for the two tasks are
		  usually quite similar and consequently the single task RTs of the two tasks
		  are about the same.  In our experiments, task 1 (mental rotation) was
		  especially time consuming, whereas task 2 (left-ear versus right-ear tone
		  discrimination) could be performed relatively quickly. According to an
		  optimization account of the PRP effect, we expected that-when SOA was
		  short-participants would temporarily interrupt task 1 processing and switch to
		  task 2, in order to minimize the total processing time RT1+RT2. That is, they
		  should complete task 2 before they finish task 1 and thus produce R2 before
		  R1. In contrast to this prediction, our results indicate that participants
		  very rarely interrupt task 1, almost always producing R1 before R2.

		  Miller (2004) proposed a "hemispheric coactivation" hypothesis to explain the
		  surprising finding that redundancy gain is larger when redundant visual
		  stimuli are presented to different hemispheres of individuals without a
		  functioning corpus callosum then when such stimuli are presented to normals.
		  According to this hypothesis (and contrary to the standard assumption of
		  contralateral hand control), unimanual responses are actually bilaterally
		  controlled, with ipsilateral as well as contralateral motor areas making a
		  substantial contribution to response initiation. An EEG experiment was
		  conducted to test for the hypothesized contribution of ipsilateral motor areas
		  to response initiation.  The results suggest that ipsilateral motor areas do
		  contribute to response initiation in a unimanual simple RT task, but not in a
		  between-hands choice RT task.

		  In two experiments, we used a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task to
		  examine the usefulness of color for the direct selection of visual information
		  for perceptual encoding. The participants' task was to discriminate whether a
		  target letter within the sequence appeared in its upper or lower case version,
		  and an advance cue indicated the color in which the target letter was most
		  likely to occur. Unlike previous studies which found no evidence for direct
		  selection by color (Põder, 2001; Shih &amp; Sperling, 1996), we used sequences in
		  which the target was the only item appearing in the cued color in validly cued
		  trials. In both experiments, accuracy was highest for valid trials.
		  Cost-benefit analysis revealed a facilitory effect of valid cues and an
		  inhibitory effect of invalid ones. These results provide strong support for
		  the idea that color cuing allows the direct selection of objects for further
		  perceptual processing.

		  Two experiments were conducted using the psychological refractory period
		  paradigm. Task 1 required a response with the middle or index finger of the
		  left hand, and task 2 required a hard or soft keypress response with the index
		  finger of the right hand.  Contrary to what is predicted by a simple
		  response-selection bottleneck model, a backward force-level crosstalk effect
		  was obtained. Specifically, Task 1 responses tended to be more forceful when
		  the task-2 stimulus called for a hard task-2 response, and they tended to be
		  less forceful when the task-2 stimulus called for a soft task-2 response. The
		  effect of the task-2 stimulus on task-1 response force suggests that the
		  task-2 stimulus/response mapping was at least partially activated before
		  task-1 processing had reached the final stage of ballistic motor output.
