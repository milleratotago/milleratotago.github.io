Subject:	Dynamic content generation demo attached

Hi:

Here are replacement files for all the main html pages, the css file and the js file. These are all wired up 
to work together. (The Software page and Javascript file also have the show/hide functionality stuff; see 
earlier mailing.)

In these pages, the nav buttons are not in the HTML (go and look, they're not there....). They are created 
dynamically when each page opens. In jom.js, you can see the code for doing this. It is commented, and I 
think it should be pretty clear. (Just let me know if not.)

The process shown -- of creating elements, configuring them, and attaching them to the HTML tree -- 
can be used to generate any content you wish. For example, you can take exactly the same approach to 
building that <address> element at the bottom, or the name/affiliation text in the banner, or whatever. I 
chose to do this one because it works off a little array, so you can see how that is done in JS.

So this is all cool, but do be aware that users who can't run JavaScript (really old browsers, really cheap 
phones, extremely suspicious people) will just see an empty space. It is easy to provide a fallback for 
them, but I haven't bothered with that yet (it's pretty unlikely that anyone accessing your website will 
be in any of these categories, but it's something to think about eventually).

I hope you are seeing my "only doing bits of it" approach as "teach a man to fish", not "That's enough 
web dev for now, I want to go watch White Collar".

Enjoy - P
