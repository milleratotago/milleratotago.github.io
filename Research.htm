      <ul>
	 <li>
	 <em>Cognitive psychology:</em> Simple human information processing mechanisms, including perception, attention, decision making, memory retrieval, mental rotation, and motor control. Some specific issues:
	 <ul>
	    <li><em>Multi-tasking.</em> Why does performance suffer when we try to do more than one task at the same time?
	       <a href="topicprp.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Discrete versus continuous models of human information processing.</em> Can we start to select an appropriate response before we have finished perceiving a stimulus, or does perception have to finish before response selection can begin?
	       <a href="topicdisccont.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Redundancy gain.</em> What happens when we try to attend to two stimuli at the same time. Can we really do that, or do we actually attend to one at a time, perhaps switching back and forth mentally?
	       <a href="topicredgain.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Selective attention.</em> What happens when we attend to one stimulus and ignore another? What sort of &quot;attentional emphasis&quot; allows us to be more aware of the attended one than the unattended? And how much do we process the one we are<i>not </i>attending to? Do we process it more than we consciously know? 
	       <a href="topicvsr.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Subliminal perception.</em> When stimuli are presented so briefly or so weakly that we are not consciously aware of them, might we still perceive them a little bit without awareness?
	       <a href="topicsublim.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Probability effects.</em> How does sensorimotor decision making depend on stimulus and response probability?
	       <a href="topicprobab.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Motor processes.</em> How are motor areas of the brain activated by cognitive processes, and vice versa?
	       <a href="topicmotor.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Other.</em> Studies that don't fit neatly into one of the above categories.
	       <a href="topicother.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	 </ul>	
	 <li>
	 <em>Quantitative and statistical models and methods:</em>  Whenever I can, I try to develop quantitative models of the phenomena I'm looking at. In addition, I like to look at the statistical methods used in the field, to see whether they might have flaws or shortcoming that can be improved upon. So, I've investigated things like:
	 <ul>
	    <li><em>Reaction time models.</em> Here, the idea is to develop a quantitative model that can describe reaction time in a set of related information processing tasks.
	       <a href="topicrtmodel.htm"><span class="references">References.</span></a>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Statistical issues.</em> Methods of statistical analysis that seem quite reasonable sometimes have unexpected consequences that could contaminate the interpretations of the results. Thus, I use computer simulations to see whether certain statistical methods give the &quot;right&quot; answers in the long run, or whether they consistently err in a given direction.

	    <li><em>Software.</em> Related free software.
